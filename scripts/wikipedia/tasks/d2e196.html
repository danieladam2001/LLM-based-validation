                  assumed the presidency shortly thereafter, and was re-elected in a landslide
                  the following year and after Slovak independence in 1993. Havel was
                  instrumental in dismantling the Warsaw Pact and enlargement of NATO
                  membership eastward. Many of his stances and policies, such as his

                  culture.[12] After finishing his military service (1957–59), Havel had to
                  bring his intellectual ambitions in line with the given circumstances,
                  especially with the restrictions imposed on him as a descendant of a
                  bourgeois family. He found employment in Prague's theatre world as a
                  stagehand at Prague's Theatre ABC&nbsp;– Divadlo ABC, and then at the Theatre on
                  Balustrade&nbsp;– Divadlo Na zábradlí. Simultaneously, he was a student of
                  dramatic arts by correspondence at the Theatre Faculty of the Academy of
                  Performing Arts in Prague (DAMU). His first own full-length play performed
                  in public, besides various vaudeville collaborations, was The Garden Party
                  (1963). Presented in a series of Theatre of the Absurd, at the Theatre on
                  Balustrade, this play won him international acclaim. The play was soon
                  followed by The Memorandum, one of his best known plays, and The Increased
                  Difficulty of Concentration, all at the Theatre on Balustrade. In 1968, The
                  Memorandum was also brought to The Public Theater in New York, which helped
                  to establish Havel's reputation in the United States. The Public Theater
                  continued to produce his plays in the following years. After 1968, Havel's
                  plays were banned from the theatre world in his own country, and he was
                  unable to leave Czechoslovakia to see any foreign performances of his
                  works.[13]</td>

               <td class="generalInfoCell">During the first week of the Warsaw Pact invasion of
                  Czechoslovakia in August 1968, Havel assisted the resistance by providing an
                  on-air narrative via Radio Free Czechoslovakia station (at Liberec).
                  Following the suppression of the Prague Spring in 1968, he was banned from
                  the theatre and became more politically active.[14] He took a job at
                  Krakonoš brewery in Trutnov, an experience he wrote about in his play
                  Audience.[15] This play, along with two other "Vaněk" plays (so-called
                  because of the recurring character Ferdinand Vaněk, a stand in for Havel),
                  became distributed in samizdat form across Czechoslovakia, and greatly added
                  to Havel's reputation of being a leading dissident (several other Czech
                  writers later wrote their own plays featuring Vaněk).[16] This reputation
                  was cemented with the publication of the Charter 77 manifesto, written
                  partially in response to the imprisonment of members of the Czech
                  psychedelic rock band The Plastic People of the Universe;[17] Havel had
                  attended their trial, which centered on the group's non-conformity in having
                  long hair, using obscenities in their music, and their overall involvement
                  in the Prague underground movement.[18] Havel co-founded the Committee for
                  the Defense of the Unjustly Prosecuted in 1979. His political activities
                  resulted in multiple imprisonments by the authorities, and constant
                  government surveillance and questioning by the secret police (Státní
                  bezpečnost). His longest period in prison, from May 1979 to February
                  1983,[18] is documented in letters to his wife that were later published as
                  Letters to Olga.</td>

                  that Havel "was leader of the Civic Forum." Being the leader of an
                  organization typically implies membership; in fact, it indicates a prominent

                     Havel" - "member of political party" - "Civic Forum"], can indeed be
                     inferred. The reasoning is as follows: The snippet states that
                     Vaclav Havel "had been the leader of the Czechoslovak Human Rights
                     movements and the main founder of the Civic Forum Party." This
                     suggests that Vaclav Havel was not only instrumental in creating the
                     Civic Forum Party but also held a significant leadership position
                     within it. While the snippet does not use the exact phrase "member
                     of the political party" to describe Havel's relationship with the
                     Civic Forum, his founding and leading role implies de facto
                     membership. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that if someone is
                     the main founder and leader of a political party, they are, by
                     implication, a member of that political party. Hence, the RDF
                     statement is supported by the information in the snippet. </td>

                     parties. The Civic Forum (Občanské fórum) was indeed a political
                     movement in Czechoslovakia during the Velvet Revolution and the
                     early years of Czech Republic's post-communist period, and Václav
                     Havel was a prominent figure associated with it. However, without
                     explicit confirmation in the snippet that Havel was a member of the
                     Civic Forum, we cannot make this inference based purely on the
                     information provided. Therefore, based on the snippet alone, the RDF
                     statement cannot be confirmed. </td>

                  provided snippet.Reasoning:- The snippet mentions that Civic Forum and its
                  Slovak counterpart won the elections in Czechoslovakia in 1990.- It states
                  that these parties, including Civic Forum, attained strong majorities in the
                  legislature and a high popular vote share.- Havel is mentioned as having
                  retained his presidency after the elections.However, the snippet does not
                  explicitly state that Václav Havel was a member of the Civic Forum political
                  party. While one might surmise that his close association with the victory
                  of Civic Forum could suggest his affiliation, the RDF statement specifically
                  relates to membership in the political party, and such an affiliation is not
                  directly stated in the snippet provided. Additional information would be
                  required to confirm this connection. It is known from historical context
                  outside of the snippet that Václav Havel was indeed a leading figure in the
                  Civic Forum, but the RDF statement being evaluated must be based solely on
                  the provided snippet, and the connection is not made explicitly
                  there.</td>

               <td class="generalInfoCell">Despite increasing political tensions between the Czechs and the
                  Slovaks in 1992, Havel supported the retention of the Czech and Slovak
                  Federative Republic prior to the dissolution of the country. Havel sought
                  re-election in 1992. Although no other candidate filed, when the vote came
                  on 3 July, he failed to get a majority due to a lack of support from Slovak
                  deputies. The largest Czech political party, the Civic Democratic Party, let
                  it be known that it would not support any other candidate. After the Slovaks
                  issued their Declaration of Independence, he resigned as president on 20
                  July, saying that he would not preside over the country's
                  breakup.[25]</td>
