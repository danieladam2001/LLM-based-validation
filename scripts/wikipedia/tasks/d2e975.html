               <td class="generalInfoCell">Yes, the RDF statement ["Bioluminescence" - "different from" -
                  "biofluorescence"] can be inferred from the given snippet, although it requires
                  knowledge of the definitions of "bioluminescence" and "biofluorescence," which are
                  not explicitly mentioned in the snippet.The snippet talks at length about
                  bioluminescence, which is the process of living organisms producing light through
                  a
                  chemical reaction that involves luciferin (mentioned in the context of genetic
                  engineering and the luciferin regenerating enzyme), ATP (in the context of ATP
                  bioluminescence), and often oxygen. These reactions occur internally within the
                  organism.Biofluorescence, however, is a process where organisms absorb light from
                  their environment and re-emit it at a lower energy level, which typically results
                  in
                  a change in color of the light. This process does not involve a light-generating
                  chemical reaction within the organisms but rather a passive re-emission of absorbed
                  light.Because the snippet explains bioluminescence in detail but does not mention
                  biofluorescence or compare the two processes, the statement describing them as
                  "different from" each other can be concluded based on the definitions of these terms
                  and the absence of any mention of biofluorescence or its characteristics in the
                  snippet.In sum, it is the distinct biological mechanisms underlying each term -
                  bioluminescence being an active, biochemical light production, and biofluorescence
                  being a passive light re-emission - that justify the RDF statement's claim of
                  difference. This knowledge, however, depends on the understanding of these
                  processes, which may need to be obtained from external biological knowledge, since
                  the snippet itself does not contrast the two.</td>

                  bioluminescent organisms, are being investigated by industrial designers.
                  Engineered bioluminescence could perhaps one day be used to reduce the need
                  for street lighting, or for decorative purposes if it becomes possible to
                  produce light that is both bright enough and can be sustained for long
                  periods at a workable price.[12][85][86] The gene that makes the tails of
                  fireflies glow has been added to mustard plants. The plants glow faintly for
                  an hour when touched, but a sensitive camera is needed to see the glow.[87]
                  University of Wisconsin–Madison is researching the use of genetically
                  engineered bioluminescent E. coli bacteria, for use as bioluminescent
                  bacteria in a light bulb.[88] In 2011, Philips launched a microbial system
                  for ambience lighting in the home.[89][90] An iGEM team from Cambridge
                  (England) has started to address the problem that luciferin is consumed in
                  the light-producing reaction by developing a genetic biotechnology part that
                  codes for a luciferin regenerating enzyme from the North American
                  firefly.[91] In 2016, Glowee, a French company started selling
                  bioluminescent lights for shop fronts and street signs,[92] for use between
                  1 and 7 in the morning when the law forbids use of electricity for this
                  purpose.[93][94] They used the bioluminescent bacterium Aliivibrio fischeri,
                  but the maximum lifetime of their product was three days.[92] In April 2020,
                  plants were genetically engineered to glow more brightly using genes from
                  the bioluminescent mushroom Neonothopanus nambi to convert caffeic acid into
                  luciferin.[94][95]</td>

                  although the information about "biofluorescence" is not explicitly
                  mentioned. Bioluminescence is described in the snippet as the production and
                  emission of light by living organisms, as seen with fireflies,
                  bioluminescent bacteria, and genetically engineered plants and mushrooms
                  that have been given genes to produce light. The entire snippet focuses on
                  this process of organisms producing light through their own biological
                  processes - which is what bioluminescence is.Biofluorescence, on the other
                  hand, is a process where organisms absorb light, transform it, and then emit
                  it as a different color. This process is not referenced or described in the
                  snippet, meaning it is a distinct phenomenon from what is being
                  discussed.Since biofluorescence and bioluminescence are based on different
                  mechanisms (production of light by an organism's own chemistry versus the
                  re-emission of absorbed light in a different color), the RDF statement
                  ["Bioluminescence" - "different from" - "biofluorescence"] is correct and
