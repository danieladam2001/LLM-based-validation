                     RDF statement asserts that Emmanuel Macron is a "member of political party" that is
                     an "independent politician." However, the provided text snippet does not contain any
                     direct information about Emmanuel Macron's political party membership or status as
                     an independent politician.In order to infer the RDF statement from the snippet,
                     there would need to be a mention of Macron's affiliation with a political party or
                     an explicit statement about him being an independent politician. Since such
                     information is absent from the snippet, we cannot draw the conclusion that the RDF
                     statement is accurate based on the provided text.As additional context (outside the
                     provided snippet), it is worth noting that Emmanuel Macron founded his own centrist
                     political movement called "La République En Marche!" (LREM or REM) in 2016, and he
                     is not generally described as an independent politician since the founding of his
                     party. Prior to that, he had been appointed as Minister of the Economy, Industry,
                     and Digital Affairs in 2014 under a Socialist Party government in France, although
                     he was not a member of the Socialist Party.Based on these circumstances and the
                     content of the snippet, we cannot infer the RDF statement "Emmanuel Macron" -
                     "member of political party" - "independent politician" to be true.</td>
