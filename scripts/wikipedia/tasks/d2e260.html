                  Masaryk obtained a doctorate at the University of Vienna and was a professor
                  of philosophy at the Czech Charles-Ferdinand University. He began his
                  political career as a deputy of the Austrian Reichsrat, serving from 1891 to
                  1893 and from 1907 to 1914. He was an advocate of restructuring the
                  Austro-Hungarian Empire into a federal state, but by the outbreak of the
                  First World War, he had become a supporter of Czech and Slovak independence.
                  He went into exile, and travelled around Europe to organise and promote the
                  Czechoslovak cause. He played a pivotal role in the establishment of the
                  Czechoslovak Legion, which fought against the Central Powers during the war.
                  In 1918, Masaryk, along with his protégés Edvard Beneš and Milan Rastislav
                  Štefánik, travelled to the United States to obtain support from President
                  Woodrow Wilson and Secretary of State Robert Lansing. Their negotiations
                  resulted in the Washington Declaration, which proclaimed the independence of
                  a Czechoslovak state.</td>

                  the best course was to seek independence for Czechs and Slovaks from
                  Austria-Hungary. He went into exile in December 1914 with his daughter,
                  Olga, staying in several places in Western Europe, the Russian Empire, the
                  United States and Japan. Masaryk began organizing Czechs and Slovaks outside
                  Austria-Hungary during his exile, establishing contacts which would be
                  crucial to Czechoslovak independence. He delivered lectures and wrote
                  several articles and memoranda supporting the Czechoslovak cause. Masaryk
                  was pivotal in establishing the Czechoslovak Legion in Russia as an
                  effective fighting force on the Allied side during World War I, when he held
                  a Serbian passport.[9] In 1915 he was one of the first staff members of the
                  School of Slavonic and East European Studies (now part of University College
                  London), where the student society and senior common room are named after
                  him. Masaryk became professor of Slavic Research at King's College London,
                  lecturing on the problem of small nations. Supported by Norman Hapgood T. G.
                  Masaryk wrote the first memorandum to president Wilson, concerning to

                  1917.[10]</td>

                  battalion to a formidable military formation. To do so, however, he realized
                  that he would need to recruit Czech and Slovak prisoners of war (POWs) in
                  Russian camps. In late 1914, Russian military authorities permitted the
                  legion to enlist Czech and Slovak POWs from the Austro-Hungarian army; the
                  order was rescinded in a few weeks, however, because of opposition from
                  other areas of the Russian government. Despite continuing efforts to
                  persuade the Russian authorities to change their minds, the Czechs and
                  Slovaks were officially barred from recruiting POWs until the summer of
                  1917.[citation needed] Under these conditions, the Czechoslovak armed unit
                  in Russia grew slowly from 1914 to 1917. Masaryk preferred to concentrate on
                  elites rather than public opinion.[12] On 19 October 1915, Masaryk gave the
                  inaugural address at the newly opened School of Slavonic Studies at King's
                  College London on "The Problem of Small Nations in the European Crisis",
                  arguing that on both moral and practical grounds that the United Kingdom
                  should support the independence efforts of "small" nations such as the
                  Czechs.[12] Shortly afterwards, Masaryk crossed the English Channel to go to
                  Paris, where he delivered a speech in French at the Institut d'études slaves
                  of the Sorbonne on "Les Slaves parmi les nations" ("The Slavs Among the
                  Nations"), receiving what was described as a "vigorous
                  applause".[12]</td>

                  supporters, spied on German and Austrian diplomats. Among other
                  achievements, the intelligence from these networks was critical in
                  uncovering the Hindu–German Conspiracy in San Francisco.[13][14][15][16]
                  Masaryk began teaching at London University in October 1915. He published
                  "Racial Problems in Hungary", with ideas about Czechoslovak independence. In
                  1916, Masaryk went to France to convince the French government of the
                  necessity of dismantling Austria-Hungary. He consulted with his friend
                  professor Pavel Miliukov, a leading Russian historian and one of the leaders
                  of the Kadet Party, to introduce him to various members of Russian high
                  society.[12]</td>
