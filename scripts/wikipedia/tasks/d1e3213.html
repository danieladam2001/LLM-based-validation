                     situation and voter base of Emmanuel Macron, but it does not
                     contain any information related to his spouse, Brigitte
                     Macron. The fact that Macron does not have a strong anchor

                     It was also the setting for a fraught encounter in the
                     campaign’s closing days, which revealed much about the man

                  <td class="generalInfoCell">When the French select their president on May
                     7th, Amiens is set to back its most famous son. In
                     first-round voting he came top there, scoring four points
                     above his national result. Yet the town’s gritty industrial
                     vulnerability also makes it an awkward home turf for the
                     candidate whom Marine Le Pen, his nationalist opponent,
                     pillories as the champion of “savage globalisation”,
                     “arrogant finance” and the rootless elite. Its unemployment
                     rate, at 12%, is above the national average. In recent years
                     Amiens has lost a mattress factory and a tyre plant. Now the
                     Whirlpool factory, where 286 workers make tumble-dryers, is
                     closing too, with production moving to lower-cost Poland.
                     The town’s troubles, in short, put Mr Macron’s pro-European
                     creed of open borders and corporate freedom sorely to the
                     test.</td>

                     last made a campaign stop in Amiens. It began dismally. As
                     he sat down with union leaders in a meeting room in the town
                     centre, Ms Le Pen staged an ambush. Turning up unannounced
                     at the Whirlpool factory gate on the outskirts, she claimed
                     to be supporting “the workers” while Mr Macron was defending
                     “the oligarchy”. His team hastily scheduled a campaign stop
                     at the factory that afternoon. It was a brave decision. As
                     plumes of black smoke rose from burning tyres, unionists in
                     fluorescent jackets awaited his arrival in a hostile,
                     muscular block. The acrid stink of charred rubber hung in
                     the air. “We don’t expect anything of Macron, he’s just the
                     continuation of Hollande,” declared Jean Santerre, a worker
                     at the factory for 23 years. He said that he and his
                     colleagues will vote for Ms Le Pen, because she will “shut
                     the borders” and stop foreigners taking French
                     jobs.</td>

                     picket line, just in case. Yet for nearly an hour the

                     arguing his case, and refusing to make empty promises. Non,

                     presidential stature. He has often appeared more ambiguous
                     than decisive, more charming than tough. Even in France,
                     which treats public intellectuals like national treasures,

                     finally told an anecdote on stage in Paris this week, it was
                     about a philosopher. Perhaps the only thing that his
                     detractors and admirers agree on is that Mr Macron is “dans

                     left with the impression that he has listened, and valued

                     a potentially unstable parliament after legislative

                     swept aside political veterans and is now dictating terms to
                     them. In 2012 Mr Hollande also visited a factory, a
                     steelworks, during his campaign. He vowed to rescue it,
                     failed while in office, and political disillusion ensued. Mr
                     Macron’s gutsier approach in Amiens may not be what wins him
