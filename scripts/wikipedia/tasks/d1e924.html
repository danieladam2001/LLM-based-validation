                     RDF statement provided is:["Emmanuel Macron" - "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"]This RDF
                     statement implies a relationship where "Emmanuel Macron" has a spouse named
                     "Brigitte Macron."Upon reviewing the provided snippet, there is a mention of a
                     relationship between Emmanuel Macron and a person named Brigitte Auzière, as
                     follows:"His parents sent him to Paris due to their alarm at the bond he had formed
                     with Brigitte Auzière, a married teacher with three children at Jésuites de la
                     Providence, who later became his wife."This constitutes evidence of a marital
                     relationship between Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Auzière, who is known to be
                     Brigitte Macron. Therefore, though the exact name "Brigitte Macron" is not used in
                     the snippet, the context provides enough information to infer that Brigitte Auzière
                     is indeed the person who became Emmanuel Macron's spouse. Her marriage to Emmanuel
                     Macron is confirmed by the phrase "who later became his wife," which aligns with the
                     RDF statement.Thus, despite the initial statement that no inference can be made, the
                     conclusion after an in-depth review of the snippet is that the RDF statement can
                     actually be inferred given that Brigitte Auzière is the same person as Brigitte
                     Macron. The reasoning is based on the connection established in the text, which
                     indicates the marital relationship between Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte
                     Auzière/Macron.</td>

                     Neither of those facts is provided in the snippet. Therefore, the

                     the relationship stated in the RDF, we would need a snippet that explicitly
                     mentions Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Macron being married or at least

                     marital status or the name of his spouse. Reasoning:
                     Information about the personal life of Emmanuel Macron,
                     including the identity of his spouse, is not provided in
                     this snippet. Hence, the RDF statement that concerns
                     Emmanuel Macron's spouse being Brigitte Macron cannot be
                     inferred from this text. To verify such a relationship, one
                     would need information that explicitly states or implies
                     that Brigitte Macron is the spouse of Emmanuel Macron, which
                     is not present in the given snippet. </td>

                     Emmanuel Macron, it might start and end in the town of
                     Amiens. On the big-skied plains of the Somme, amid the woods
                     and the fields of yellow rape that cover former bloody
                     battlefields, this redbrick working-class city is the French
                     presidential candidate’s hometown. With its soaring
                     13th-century cathedral, and charmless rebuilt central drag,
                     Amiens is arresting both for its splendour and its banality.
                     It is the place that shaped Mr Macron, and the town he fled.
                     It was also the setting for a fraught encounter in the
                     campaign’s closing days, which revealed much about the man
                     who could soon be the next, and youngest-ever, president of

                     the Socialist Party he once belonged to, and the president

                     above his national result. Yet the town’s gritty industrial

                     Amiens has lost a mattress factory and a tyre plant. Now the
                     Whirlpool factory, where 286 workers make tumble-dryers, is

                     he sat down with union leaders in a meeting room in the town
                     centre, Ms Le Pen staged an ambush. Turning up unannounced

                     at the factory that afternoon. It was a brave decision. As
                     plumes of black smoke rose from burning tyres, unionists in
                     fluorescent jackets awaited his arrival in a hostile,
                     muscular block. The acrid stink of charred rubber hung in
                     the air. “We don’t expect anything of Macron, he’s just the
                     continuation of Hollande,” declared Jean Santerre, a worker
                     at the factory for 23 years. He said that he and his
