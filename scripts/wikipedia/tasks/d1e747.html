                     toppled the Communist system in Czechoslovakia in 1989." This sentence explicitly
                     mentions that Civic Forum is Havel's party, which implies that he was a member of
                     this political party. The context of this sentence makes it clear that Václav Havel
                     was not only a member but also a significant figure within the Civic Forum party.

                     Restored Vladimir Tismaneanu (bio) The 1989 revolutions in
                     Central and Eastern Europe signaled the demise of the
                     communist bloc. They represent the triumph of civic dignity
                     and political morality over ideological monism, bureaucratic
                     cynicism, and police-state dictatorship. Their significance
                     cannot be overestimated. The ousting of communist rule
                     across the region that began that year irrevocably altered
                     the geopolitical landscape. But it also gave rise to a
                     potentially dangerous situation, as the absence of norms and
                     predictable rational behavior in the postcommunist states
                     conceivably could have led to global chaos. This is not to
                     wax nostalgic for the Cold War–era world order, but simply
                     to point out that the end of Leninism and the fall of the
                     Iron Curtain created a radically novel situation. It in no
                     way diminishes the triumph of 1989 to acknowledge that
                     ethnic rivalries, rampant political and economic corruption,
                     and the rise of illiberal political parties and movements as
                     well as collectivist and nativist trends have afflicted much
                     of the postcommunist world since then. Understanding the
                     repercussions of "the upheaval in the East," however, will
                     help us better to grasp the meaning of ongoing debates about
                     liberalism, socialism, nationalism, civil society, and the
                     very notion of human freedom in the aftermath of a most
                     atrocious century.1 After 1989, Central and Eastern Europe
                     had to make the transition from Leninist pseudomodernization
                     to genuine modernity. This was no simple task, for at the
                     root of most postcommunist problems lay the misdevelopment
                     of society under Leninism. As Tony Judt noted, "seventy [End
                     Page 128] years of energetic claims to the contrary
                     notwithstanding . . . there was indeed no Communist society
                     as such: only a wilting state and its anxious citizens."2 At
                     the beginning of the 1990s, I argued that the leading cause
                     of communism's collapse was the resurrection and development
                     of civil society.3 Absent an active civil society, the
                     revolutions of 1989 would have been replaced, at best, by a
                     so-called enlightened despotism. With the end of state
                     socialism came the crucial task of restoring the social glue
                     that had been dissolved by the endemic corruption and moral
                     disarray that plagued these societies. Caught up in the
                     romance of revolutionary excitement, most observers glossed
                     over the diversity of the anticommunist movements. Not
                     everyone who rejected Leninism did so because he or she was
                     dreaming of an open society founded on liberal values. Among
                     the revolutionaries were populist fundamentalists, religious
                     zealots, and those who longed for the return of the
                     undemocratic precommunist regimes. It was only after the
                     disintegration of Yugoslavia and the "velvet divorce"
                     between the Czechs and Slovaks that scholars and policy
                     makers began to realize that the liberal promise of these
                     revolutions could not be taken for granted and that
                     communism would not necessarily be followed by liberal
                     democracy. In the early 1990s, it became unmistakably clear
                     that the postcommunist era was fraught with all manner of
                     threats, as much of the region descended into bloody ethnic
                     conflict and social unrest, and saw the infectious rise of
                     old and new kinds of populism and tribalism.4 Nowhere were
                     the perils of postcommunism more evident than in the
                     Balkans, where democratic values completely shattered under
                     ethnocratic pressure soon after communism fell. The wars of
                     secession in Yugoslavia proved to be Eastern Europe's
                     paradigmatic worst-case scenario. In the former Yugoslav
                     federation, we witnessed what I once called the "Belgrade
                     syndrome," a form of populism instrumentalized through
                     militaristic, expansionist policies and demagogic
                     nationalism. Its purpose was to preserve the political
                     domination of the ex-communist, radically nationalist elite
                     that was loyal to Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević, whose
                     personalistic, ethnocentric, and authoritarian regime rested
                     on the ruling Socialist Party, secret police, and army. This
                     type of politics was not ideological; it was neither left
                     nor right. Rather, policies were adopted only in accord with
                     the needs and whims of the power holders. Elites deployed
                     nationalistic, manipulative political slogans with utter
                     disregard for their long-term consequences. The popularity

                     countries as Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Romania, and
                     Slovakia) in the first decade of postcommunism seemed... </td>

                     specific individuals' membership in political parties. The
                     Civic Forum was indeed a significant political movement in
                     Czechoslovakia during the Velvet Revolution in 1989, and
                     Václav Havel was a prominent figure associated with it.

                     society in the transformation that took place. - The snippet
                     does not mention Václav Havel directly, nor does it
                     reference his membership in any political party, including
                     the Civic Forum. - The RDF statement refers to a specific
                     fact about Václav Havel being a member of a political party
                     named Civic Forum, which is not addressed in the snippet.
                     Therefore, based on the information given in the snippet, we
                     cannot infer the RDF statement about Václav Havel's
                     affiliation with the Civic Forum. Additional information is

                     excitement, most observers glossed over the diversity of the
                     anticommunist movements. Not everyone who rejected Leninism
                     did so because he or she was dreaming of an open society
                     founded on liberal values. Among the revolutionaries were
                     populist fundamentalists, religious zealots, and those who
                     longed for the return of the undemocratic precommunist
                     regimes. It was only after the disintegration of Yugoslavia
                     and the "velvet divorce" between the Czechs and Slovaks that
                     scholars and policy makers began to realize that the liberal
                     promise of these revolutions could not be taken for granted
                     and that communism would not necessarily be followed by
                     liberal democracy. In the early 1990s, it became
                     unmistakably clear that the postcommunist era was fraught
                     with all manner of threats, as much of the region descended
                     into bloody ethnic conflict and social unrest, and saw the
                     infectious rise of old and new kinds of populism and

                     does not explicitly state that Václav Havel was a member of the Civic Forum.
                     The Civic Forum's victory and Havel's presidency suggest a close
                     relationship, but one cannot infer membership solely based on this snippet
                     without making assumptions. For the RDF statement to be inferred, the
                     snippet would need to contain explicit information stating that Václav Havel
