                     received specifically for the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Play.The snippet
                     primarily discusses Václav Havel's career, his political life, his death, tributes
                     from world leaders, and various honors and awards he received. It does mention he
                     has been awarded several prizes and honors, including the Erasmus Prize, the
                     Friedenspreis des Deutschen Buchhandels, and the Gottlieb Duttweiler Prize, among
                     others. It also states that Havel was involved in the arts and literature, as
                     evidenced by his election to various societies and receipt of honorary degrees, and
                     that there exists a Václav Havel Library that houses his literary works. However,
                     there is no specific mention of a nomination for the Drama Desk Award for
