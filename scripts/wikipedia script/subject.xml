                <groupText> Bioluminescence is the production and emission of light by living
                    organisms. It is a form of chemiluminescence. Bioluminescence occurs widely in
                    marine vertebrates and invertebrates, as well as in some fungi, microorganisms
                    including some bioluminescent bacteria, and terrestrial arthropods such as
                    fireflies. In some animals, the light is bacteriogenic, produced by symbiotic
                    bacteria such as those from the genus Vibrio;[1] in others, it is autogenic,
                    produced by the animals themselves. In a general sense, the principal chemical
                    reaction in bioluminescence involves a light-emitting molecule and an enzyme,
                    generally called luciferin and luciferase, respectively. Because these are
                    generic names, luciferins and luciferases are often distinguished by the species
                    or group, e.g. firefly luciferin. In all characterized cases, the enzyme
                    catalyzes the oxidation of the luciferin. In some species, the luciferase
                    requires other cofactors, such as calcium or magnesium ions, and sometimes also
                    the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In evolution,
                    luciferins vary little: one in particular, coelenterazine, is found in 11
                    different animal phyla, though in some of these, the animals obtain it through
                    their diet. Conversely, luciferases vary widely between different species.
                    Bioluminescence has arisen over 40 times in evolutionary history. Both Aristotle
                    and Pliny the Elder mentioned that damp wood sometimes gives off a glow. Many
                    centuries later Robert Boyle showed that oxygen was involved in the process, in
                    both wood and glowworms. It was not until the late nineteenth century that
                    bioluminescence was properly investigated. The phenomenon is widely distributed
                    among animal groups, especially in marine environments. On land it occurs in
                    fungi, bacteria and some groups of invertebrates, including insects. The uses of
                    bioluminescence by animals include counterillumination camouflage, mimicry of
                    other animals, for example to lure prey, and signaling to other individuals of
                    the same species, such as to attract mates. In the laboratory, luciferase-based
                    systems are used in genetic engineering and biomedical research. Researchers are
                    also investigating the possibility of using bioluminescent systems for street
                    and decorative lighting, and a bioluminescent plant has been created.[2] Before
                    the development of the safety lamp for use in coal mines, dried fish skins were
                    used in Britain and Europe as a weak source of light.[3] This experimental form
                    of illumination avoided the necessity of using candles which risked sparking
                    explosions of firedamp.[4] In 1920, the American zoologist E. Newton Harvey
                    published a monograph, The Nature of Animal Light, summarizing early work on
                    bioluminescence. Harvey notes that Aristotle mentions light produced by dead
                    fish and flesh, and that both Aristotle and Pliny the Elder (in his Natural
                    History) mention light from damp wood. He records that Robert Boyle experimented
                    on these light sources, and showed that both they and the glowworm require air
                    for light to be produced. Harvey notes that in 1753, J. Baker identified the
                    flagellate Noctiluca "as a luminous animal" "just visible to the naked eye",[5]
                    and in 1854 Johann Florian Heller (1813–1871) identified strands (hyphae) of
                    fungi as the source of light in dead wood.[6] Tuckey, in his posthumous 1818
                    Narrative of the Expedition to the Zaire, described catching the animals
                    responsible for luminescence. He mentions pellucids, crustaceans (to which he
                    ascribes the milky whiteness of the water), and cancers (shrimps and crabs).
                    Under the microscope he described the "luminous property" to be in the brain,
                    resembling "a most brilliant amethyst about the size of a large pin's head".[7]
                    Charles Darwin noticed bioluminescence in the sea, describing it in his Journal:
                    While sailing in these latitudes on one very dark night, the sea presented a
                    wonderful and most beautiful spectacle. There was a fresh breeze, and every part
                    of the surface, which during the day is seen as foam, now glowed with a pale
                    light. The vessel drove before her bows two billows of liquid phosphorus, and in
                    her wake she was followed by a milky train. As far as the eye reached, the crest
                    of every wave was bright, and the sky above the horizon, from the reflected
                    glare of these livid flames, was not so utterly obscure, as over the rest of the
                    heavens.[8] Darwin also observed a luminous "jelly-fish of the genus
                    Dianaea",[8] noting that: "When the waves scintillate with bright green sparks,
                    I believe it is generally owing to minute crustacea. But there can be no doubt
                    that very many other pelagic animals, when alive, are phosphorescent."[8] He
                    guessed that "a disturbed electrical condition of the atmosphere"[8] was
                    probably responsible. Daniel Pauly comments that Darwin "was lucky with most of
                    his guesses, but not here",[9] noting that biochemistry was too little known,
                    and that the complex evolution of the marine animals involved "would have been
                    too much for comfort".[9] Bioluminescence attracted the attention of the United
                    States Navy in the Cold War, since submarines in some waters can create a bright
                    enough wake to be detected; a German submarine was sunk in the First World War,
                    having been detected in this way. The navy was interested in predicting when
                    such detection would be possible, and hence guiding their own submarines to
                    avoid detection.[11] Among the anecdotes of navigation by bioluminescence is one
                    recounted by the Apollo 13 astronaut Jim Lovell, who as a navy pilot had found
                    his way back to his aircraft carrier USS Shangri-La when his navigation systems
                    failed. Turning off his cabin lights, he saw the glowing wake of the ship, and
                    was able to fly to it and land safely.[12] The French pharmacologist Raphaël
                    Dubois carried out work on bioluminescence in the late nineteenth century. He
                    studied click beetles (Pyrophorus) and the marine bivalve mollusc Pholas
                    dactylus. He refuted the old idea that bioluminescence came from
                    phosphorus,[13][a] and demonstrated that the process was related to the
                    oxidation of a specific compound, which he named luciferin, by an enzyme.[15] He
                    sent Harvey siphons from the mollusc preserved in sugar. Harvey had become
                    interested in bioluminescence as a result of visiting the South Pacific and
                    Japan and observing phosphorescent organisms there. He studied the phenomenon
                    for many years. His research aimed to demonstrate that luciferin, and the
                    enzymes that act on it to produce light, were interchangeable between species,
                    showing that all bioluminescent organisms had a common ancestor. However, he
                    found this hypothesis to be false, with different organisms having major
                    differences in the composition of their light-producing proteins. He spent the
                    next 30 years purifying and studying the components, but it fell to the young
                    Japanese chemist Osamu Shimomura to be the first to obtain crystalline
                    luciferin. He used the sea firefly Vargula hilgendorfii, but it was another ten
                    years before he discovered the chemical's structure and published his 1957 paper
                    Crystalline Cypridina Luciferin.[16] Shimomura, Martin Chalfie, and Roger Y.
                    Tsien won the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their 1961 discovery and
                    development of green fluorescent protein as a tool for biological research.[17]
                    Harvey wrote a detailed historical account on all forms of luminescence in
                    1957.[18] An updated book on bioluminescence covering also the twentieth and
                    early twenty-first century was published recently.[19][20] In 1932 E. N. Harvey
                    was among the first to propose how bioluminescence could have evolved.[21] In
                    this early paper, he suggested that proto-bioluminescence could have arisen from
                    respiratory chain proteins that hold fluorescent groups. This hypothesis has
                    since been disproven, but it did lead to considerable interest in the origins of
                    the phenomenon. Today, the two prevailing hypotheses (both concerning marine
                    bioluminescence) are those put forth by Howard Seliger in 1993 and Rees et al.
                    in 1998.[22][23] Seliger's theory identifies luciferase enzymes as the catalyst
                    for the evolution of bioluminescent systems. It suggests that the original
                    purpose of luciferases was as mixed-function oxygenases. As the early ancestors
                    of many species moved into deeper and darker waters natural selection favored
                    the development of increased eye sensitivity and enhanced visual signals.[24] If
                    selection were to favor a mutation in the oxygenase enzyme required for the
                    breakdown of pigment molecules (molecules often associated with spots used to
                    attract a mate or distract a predator) it could have eventually resulted in
                    external luminescence in tissues.[22] Rees et al. use evidence gathered from the
                    marine luciferin coelenterazine to suggest that selection acting on luciferins
                    may have arisen from pressures to protect oceanic organisms from potentially
                    deleterious reactive oxygen species (e.g. H2O2 and O2− ). The functional shift
                    from antioxidation to bioluminescence probably occurred when the strength of
                    selection for antioxidation defense decreased as early species moved further
                    down the water column. At greater depths exposure to ROS is significantly lower,
                    as is the endogenous production of ROS through metabolism.[23] </groupText>

                <groupText>While popular at first, Seliger's theory has been challenged,
                    particularly on the biochemical and genetic evidence that Rees examines. What
                    remains clear, however, is that bioluminescence has evolved independently at
                    least 40 times.[25] Bioluminescence in fish began at least by the Cretaceous
                    period. About 1,500 fish species are known to be bioluminescent; the capability
                    evolved independently at least 27 times. Of these, 17 involved the taking up of
                    bioluminous bacteria from the surrounding water while in the others, the
                    intrinsic light evolved through chemical synthesis. These fish have become
                    surprisingly diverse in the deep ocean and control their light with the help of
                    their nervous system, using it not just to lure prey or hide from predators, but
                    also for communication.[26][27] All bioluminescent organisms have in common that
                    the reaction of a "luciferin" and oxygen is catalyzed by a luciferase to produce
                    light.[28] McElroy and Seliger proposed in 1962 that the bioluminescent reaction
                    evolved to detoxify oxygen, in parallel with photosynthesis.[29] Thuesen, Davis
                    et al. showed in 2016 that bioluminescence has evolved independently 27 times
                    within 14 fish clades across ray-finned fishes.[26] The oldest of these appears
                    to be Stomiiformes and Myctophidae.[30] In sharks, bioluminescence has evolved
                    only once.[31] Genomic analysis of octocorals indicates that their ancestor was
                    bioluminescent as long as 540 million years ago.[32] Bioluminescence is a form
                    of chemiluminescence where light energy is released by a chemical reaction. This
                    reaction involves a light-emitting pigment, the luciferin, and a luciferase, the
                    enzyme component.[33] Because of the diversity of luciferin/luciferase
                    combinations, there are very few commonalities in the chemical mechanism. From
                    currently studied systems, the only unifying mechanism is the role of molecular
                    oxygen; often there is a concurrent release of carbon dioxide (CO2). For
                    example, the firefly luciferin/luciferase reaction requires magnesium and ATP
                    and produces CO2, adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophosphate (PP) as waste
                    products. Other cofactors may be required, such as calcium (Ca2+) for the
                    photoprotein aequorin, or magnesium (Mg2+) ions and ATP for the firefly
                    luciferase.[34] Generically, this reaction can be described as: Instead of a
                    luciferase, the jellyfish Aequorea victoria makes use of another type of protein
                    called a photoprotein, in this case specifically aequorin.[35] When calcium ions
                    are added, rapid catalysis creates a brief flash quite unlike the prolonged glow
                    produced by luciferase. In a second, much slower step, luciferin is regenerated
                    from the oxidized (oxyluciferin) form, allowing it to recombine with aequorin,
                    in preparation for a subsequent flash. Photoproteins are thus enzymes, but with
                    unusual reaction kinetics.[36] Furthermore, some of the blue light released by
                    aequorin in contact with calcium ions is absorbed by a green fluorescent
                    protein, which in turn releases green light in a process called resonant energy
                    transfer.[37] Overall, bioluminescence has arisen over 40 times in evolutionary
                    history.[33] In evolution, luciferins tend to vary little: one in particular,
                    coelenterazine, is the light emitting pigment for nine phyla (groups of very
                    different organisms), including polycystine radiolaria, Cercozoa (Phaeodaria),
                    protozoa, comb jellies, cnidaria including jellyfish and corals, crustaceans,
                    molluscs, arrow worms and vertebrates (ray-finned fish). Not all these organisms
                    synthesise coelenterazine: some of them obtain it through their diet.[33]
                    Conversely, luciferase enzymes vary widely and tend to be different in each
                    species.[33] Bioluminescence occurs widely among animals, especially in the open
                    sea, including fish, jellyfish, comb jellies, crustaceans, and cephalopod
                    molluscs; in some fungi and bacteria; and in various terrestrial invertebrates,
                    nearly all of which are beetles. In marine coastal habitats, about 2.5% of
                    organisms are estimated to be bioluminescent, whereas in pelagic habitats in the
                    eastern Pacific, about 76% of the main taxa of deep-sea animals have been found
                    to be capable of producing light.[38] More than 700 animal genera have been
                    recorded with light-producing species.[39] Most marine light-emission is in the
                    blue and green light spectrum. However, some loose-jawed fish emit red and
                    infrared light, and the genus Tomopteris emits yellow light.[33][40] The most
                    frequently encountered bioluminescent organisms may be the dinoflagellates in
                    the surface layers of the sea, which are responsible for the sparkling
                    luminescence sometimes seen at night in disturbed water. At least 18 genera of
                    these phytoplankton exhibit luminosity.[33] Luminescent dinoflagellate
                    ecosystems are present in warm water lagoons and bays with narrow openings to
                    the ocean.[41] A different effect is the thousands of square miles of the ocean
                    which shine with the light produced by bioluminescent bacteria, known as mareel
                    or the milky seas effect.[42] Bioluminescence is abundant in the pelagic zone,
                    with the most concentration at depths devoid of light and surface waters at
                    night. These organisms participate in diurnal vertical migration from the dark
                    depths to the surface at night, dispersing the population of bioluminescent
                    organisms across the pelagic water column. The dispersal of bioluminescence
                    across different depths in the pelagic zone has been attributed to the selection
                    pressures imposed by predation and the lack of places to hide in the open sea.
                    In depths where sunlight never penetrates, often below 200m, the significance of
                    bioluminescent is evident in the retainment of functional eyes for organisms to
                    detect bioluminescence.[43] Organisms often produce bioluminescence themselves,
                    rarely do they generate it from outside phenomena. However, there are occasions
                    where bioluminescence is produced by bacterial symbionts that have a symbiotic
                    relationship with the host organism. Although many luminous bacteria in the
                    marine environment are free-living, a majority are found in symbiotic
                    relationships that involve fish, squids, crustaceans etc. as hosts. Most
                    luminous bacteria inhabit the sea, dominated by Photobacterium and Vibrio.[44]
                    In the symbiotic relationship, bacterium benefit from having a source of
                    nourishment and a refuge to grow. Hosts obtain these bacterial symbionts either
                    from the environment, spawning, or the luminous bacterium is evolving with their
                    host.[45] Coevolutionary interactions are suggested as host organisms'
                    anatomical adaptations have become specific to only certain luminous bacteria,
                    to suffice ecological dependence of bioluminescence.[46] Bioluminescence is
                    widely studied amongst species located in the mesopelagic zone, but the benthic
                    zone at mesopelagic depths has remained widely unknown. Benthic habitats at
                    depths beyond the mesopelagic are also poorly understood due to the same
                    constraints. Unlike the pelagic zone where the emission of light is undisturbed
                    in the open sea, the occurrence of bioluminescence in the benthic zone is less
                    common. It has been attributed to the blockage of emitted light by a number of
                    sources such as the sea floor, and inorganic and organic structures. Visual
                    signals and communication that is prevalent in the pelagic zone such as
                    counter-illumination may not be functional or relevant in the benthic realm.
                    Bioluminescence in bathyal benthic species still remains poorly studied due to
                    difficulties of the collection of species at these depths.[47] Bioluminescence
                    has several functions in different taxa. Steven Haddock et al. (2010) list as
                    more or less definite functions in marine organisms the following: defensive
                    functions of startle, counterillumination (camouflage), misdirection (smoke
                    screen), distractive body parts, burglar alarm (making predators easier for
                    higher predators to see), and warning to deter settlers; offensive functions of
                    lure, stun or confuse prey, illuminate prey, and mate attraction/recognition. It
                    is much easier for researchers to detect that a species is able to produce light
                    than to analyze the chemical mechanisms or to prove what function the light
                    serves.[33] In some cases the function is unknown, as with species in three
                    families of earthworm (Oligochaeta), such as Diplocardia longa, where the
                    coelomic fluid produces light when the animal moves.[48] The following functions
                    are reasonably well established in the named organisms. In many animals of the
                    deep sea, including several squid species, bacterial bioluminescence is used for
                    camouflage by counterillumination, in which the animal matches the overhead
                    environmental light as seen from below.[49] In these animals, photoreceptors
                    control the illumination to match the brightness of the background.[49] These
                    light organs are usually separate from the tissue containing the bioluminescent
                    bacteria. However, in one species, Euprymna scolopes, the bacteria are an
                    integral component of the animal's light organ.[50] Bioluminescence is used in a
                    variety of ways and for different purposes. The cirrate octopod Stauroteuthis
                    syrtensis uses emits bioluminescence from its sucker like structures.[51] These
                    structures are believed to have evolved from what are more commonly known as
                    octopus suckers. They do not have the same function as the normal suckers
                    because they no longer have any handling or grappling ability due its evolution
                    of photophores. The placement of the photophores are within the animals oral
                    reach, which leads researchers to suggest that it uses it bioluminescence to
                    capture and lure prey.[52] </groupText>

                <groupText>Fireflies use light to attract mates. Two systems are involved according
                    to species; in one, females emit light from their abdomens to attract males; in
                    the other, flying males emit signals to which the sometimes sedentary females
                    respond.[48][53] Click beetles emit an orange light from the abdomen when flying
                    and a green light from the thorax when they are disturbed or moving about on the
                    ground. The former is probably a sexual attractant but the latter may be
                    defensive.[48] Larvae of the click beetle Pyrophorus nyctophanus live in the
                    surface layers of termite mounds in Brazil. They light up the mounds by emitting
                    a bright greenish glow which attracts the flying insects on which they feed.[48]
                    In the marine environment, use of luminescence for mate attraction is chiefly
                    known among ostracods, small shrimp-like crustaceans, especially in the family
                    Cyprididae. Pheromones may be used for long-distance communication, with
                    bioluminescence used at close range to enable mates to "home in".[33] A
                    polychaete worm, the Bermuda fireworm creates a brief display, a few nights
                    after the full moon, when the female lights up to attract males.[54] The defense
                    mechanisms for bioluminescent organisms can come in multiple forms; startling
                    prey, counter-illumination, smoke screen or misdirection, distractive body
                    parts, burglar alarm, sacrificial tag or warning coloration. The shrimp family
                    Oplophoridae Dana use their bioluminescence as a way of startling the predator
                    that is after them.[55] Acanthephyra purpurea, within the Oplophoridae family,
                    uses its photophores to emit light, and can secrete a bioluminescent substance
                    when in the presence of a predator. This secretory mechanism is common among
                    prey fish.[55] Many cephalopods, including at least 70 genera of squid, are
                    bioluminescent.[33] Some squid and small crustaceans use bioluminescent chemical
                    mixtures or bacterial slurries in the same way as many squid use ink. A cloud of
                    luminescent material is expelled, distracting or repelling a potential predator,
                    while the animal escapes to safety.[33] The deep sea squid Octopoteuthis
                    deletron may autotomize portions of its arms which are luminous and continue to
                    twitch and flash, thus distracting a predator while the animal flees.[33]
                    Dinoflagellates may use bioluminescence for defense against predators. They
                    shine when they detect a predator, possibly making the predator itself more
                    vulnerable by attracting the attention of predators from higher trophic
                    levels.[33] Grazing copepods release any phytoplankton cells that flash,
                    unharmed; if they were eaten they would make the copepods glow, attracting
                    predators, so the phytoplankton's bioluminescence is defensive. The problem of
                    shining stomach contents is solved (and the explanation corroborated) in
                    predatory deep-sea fishes: their stomachs have a black lining able to keep the
                    light from any bioluminescent fish prey which they have swallowed from
                    attracting larger predators.[9] The sea-firefly is a small crustacean living in
                    sediment. At rest it emits a dull glow but when disturbed it darts away leaving
                    a cloud of shimmering blue light to confuse the predator. During World War II it
                    was gathered and dried for use by the Japanese army as a source of light during
                    clandestine operations.[16] The larvae of railroad worms (Phrixothrix) have
                    paired photic organs on each body segment, able to glow with green light; these
                    are thought to have a defensive purpose.[56] They also have organs on the head
                    which produce red light; they are the only terrestrial organisms to emit light
                    of this color.[57] Aposematism is a widely used function of bioluminescence,
                    providing a warning that the creature concerned is unpalatable. It is suggested
                    that many firefly larvae glow to repel predators; some millipedes glow for the
                    same purpose.[58] Some marine organisms are believed to emit light for a similar
                    reason. These include scale worms, jellyfish and brittle stars but further
                    research is needed to fully establish the function of the luminescence. Such a
                    mechanism would be of particular advantage to soft-bodied cnidarians if they
                    were able to deter predation in this way.[33] The limpet Latia neritoides is the
                    only known freshwater gastropod that emits light. It produces greenish
                    luminescent mucus which may have an anti-predator function.[59] The marine snail
                    Hinea brasiliana uses flashes of light, probably to deter predators. The
                    blue-green light is emitted through the translucent shell, which functions as an
                    efficient diffuser of light.[60] Communication in the form of quorum sensing
                    plays a role in the regulation of luminescence in many species of bacteria.
                    Small extracellularly secreted molecules stimulate the bacteria to turn on genes
                    for light production when cell density, measured by concentration of the
                    secreted molecules, is high.[33] Pyrosomes are colonial tunicates and each zooid
                    has a pair of luminescent organs on either side of the inlet siphon. When
                    stimulated by light, these turn on and off, causing rhythmic flashing. No neural
                    pathway runs between the zooids, but each responds to the light produced by
                    other individuals, and even to light from other nearby colonies.[61]
                    Communication by light emission between the zooids enables coordination of
                    colony effort, for example in swimming where each zooid provides part of the
                    propulsive force.[62] Some bioluminous bacteria infect nematodes that parasitize
                    Lepidoptera larvae. When these caterpillars die, their luminosity may attract
                    predators to the dead insect thus assisting in the dispersal of both bacteria
                    and nematodes.[48] A similar reason may account for the many species of fungi
                    that emit light. Species in the genera Armillaria, Mycena, Omphalotus, Panellus,
                    Pleurotus and others do this, emitting usually greenish light from the mycelium,
                    cap and gills. This may attract night-flying insects and aid in spore dispersal,
                    but other functions may also be involved.[48] Quantula striata is the only known
                    bioluminescent terrestrial mollusk. Pulses of light are emitted from a gland
                    near the front of the foot and may have a communicative function, although the
                    adaptive significance is not fully understood.[63] Bioluminescence is used by a
                    variety of animals to mimic other species. Many species of deep sea fish such as
                    the anglerfish and dragonfish make use of aggressive mimicry to attract prey.
                    They have an appendage on their heads called an esca that contains
                    bioluminescent bacteria able to produce a long-lasting glow which the fish can
                    control. The glowing esca is dangled or waved about to lure small animals to
                    within striking distance of the fish.[33][64] The cookiecutter shark uses
                    bioluminescence to camouflage its underside by counter-illumination, but a small
                    patch near its pectoral fins remains dark, appearing as a small fish to large
                    predatory fish like tuna and mackerel swimming beneath it. When such fish
                    approach the lure, they are bitten by the shark.[65][66] Female Photuris
                    fireflies sometimes mimic the light pattern of another firefly, Photinus, to
                    attract its males as prey. In this way they obtain both food and the defensive
                    chemicals named lucibufagins, which Photuris cannot synthesize.[67] South
                    American giant cockroaches of the genus Lucihormetica were believed to be the
                    first known example of defensive mimicry, emitting light in imitation of
                    bioluminescent, poisonous click beetles.[68] However, doubt has been cast on
                    this assertion, and there is no conclusive evidence that the cockroaches are
                    bioluminescent.[69][70] While most marine bioluminescence is green to blue, some
                    deep sea barbeled dragonfishes in the genera Aristostomias, Pachystomias and
                    Malacosteus emit a red glow. This adaptation allows the fish to see
                    red-pigmented prey, which are normally invisible to other organisms in the deep
                    ocean environment where red light has been filtered out by the water column.[71]
                    These fish are able to utilize the longer wavelength to act as a spotlight for
                    its prey that only they can see.[71] The fish may also use this light to
                    communicate with each other to find potential mates.[72] The ability of the fish
                    to see this light is explained by the presence of specialized rhodopsin
                    pigment.[71] The mechanism of light creation is through a suborbital photophore
                    that utilizes gland cells which produce exergonic chemical reactions that
                    produce light with a longer, red wavelength.[73] The dragonfish species which
                    produce the red light also produce blue light in photophore on the dorsal
                    area.[73] The main function of this is to alert the fish to the presence of its
                    prey.[74] The additional pigment is thought to be assimilated from chlorophyll
                    derivatives found in the copepods which form part of its diet.[74] The angler
                    siphonophore (Erenna) utilizes red bioluminescence in appendages to lure
                    fish.[73] Bioluminescent organisms are a target for many areas of research.
                    Luciferase systems are widely used in genetic engineering as reporter genes,
                    each producing a different color by fluorescence,[75][76] and for biomedical
                    research using bioluminescence imaging.[77][78][79] For example, the firefly
                    luciferase gene was used as early as 1986 for research using transgenic tobacco
                    plants.[80] Vibrio bacteria symbiose with marine invertebrates such as the
                    Hawaiian bobtail squid (Euprymna scolopes), are key experimental models for
                    bioluminescence.[81][82] Bioluminescent activated destruction is an experimental
                    cancer treatment.[83] In Vivo luminescence cell and animal imaging uses dyes and
                    fluorescent proteins as chromophores. The characteristics of each chromophore
                    determine which cell area(s) will be targeted and illuminated.[84] </groupText>

                    Engineered bioluminescence could perhaps one day be used to reduce the need for
                    street lighting, or for decorative purposes if it becomes possible to produce
                    light that is both bright enough and can be sustained for long periods at a
                    workable price.[11][85][86] The gene that makes the tails of fireflies glow has
                    been added to mustard plants. The plants glow faintly for an hour when touched,
                    but a sensitive camera is needed to see the glow.[87] University of
                    Wisconsin–Madison is researching the use of genetically engineered
                    bioluminescent E. coli bacteria, for use as bioluminescent bacteria in a light
                    bulb.[88] In 2011, Philips launched a microbial system for ambience lighting in
                    the home.[89][90] An iGEM team from Cambridge (England) has started to address
                    the problem that luciferin is consumed in the light-producing reaction by
                    developing a genetic biotechnology part that codes for a luciferin regenerating
                    enzyme from the North American firefly.[91] In 2016, Glowee, a French company
                    started selling bioluminescent lights for shop fronts and street signs,[92] for
                    use between 1 and 7 in the morning when the law forbids use of electricity for
                    this purpose.[93][94] They used the bioluminescent bacterium Aliivibrio
                    fischeri, but the maximum lifetime of their product was three days.[92] In April
                    2020, plants were genetically engineered to glow more brightly using genes from
                    the bioluminescent mushroom Neonothopanus nambi to convert caffeic acid into
                    luciferin.[94][95] ATP bioluminescence is the process in which ATP is used to
                    generate luminescence in an organism, in conjunction with other compounds such
                    as luciferin. It proves to be a very good biosensor to test for the presence of
                    living microbes in water.[96][97] Different types of microbial populations are
                    determined through different sets of ATP assays using other substrates and
                    reagents. Renilla- and Gaussia-based cell viability assays use the substrate
                    coelenterazine.[98] </groupText>

            <modelAnswer>Yes, the RDF statement ["Bioluminescence" - "different from" -
                "iridescence"] can be inferred from the given snippet.Reasoning:The given snippet
                does not specifically compare bioluminescence to iridescence; however, the
                definition and description of bioluminescence within the text allows us to
                understand that bioluminescence is the production and emission of light by living
                organisms through a chemical reaction, highlighting its biological and
                chemiluminescent nature.Iridescence, on the other hand (although not described in
                the snippet), refers to the phenomenon where certain surfaces appear to change color
                as the angle of view or the angle of illumination changes. It is a physical
                phenomenon related to the reflection, refraction, and diffraction of light from
                surfaces, and does not involve living organisms producing light through chemical
                reactions.Since the two phenomena have different mechanisms and involve different
                processes (biological production of light in the case of bioluminescence vs.
                physical reflection and refraction of light in iridescence), it is valid to infer
                that bioluminescence is indeed different from iridescence.</modelAnswer>

                        does not mention or define iridescence. In order to infer that
                        bioluminescence is different from iridescence, the snippet would need to
                        have a description or a mention of what iridescence is, allowing for a
                        comparison between the two phenomena.Iridescence is a different optical
                        phenomenon where surfaces appear to change color as the angle of view or the
                        angle of illumination changes, which is not related to the production and
                        emission of light by living organisms as described for bioluminescence in

                        defines iridescence or compares it to bioluminescence, we cannot infer that
                        bioluminescence is different from iridescence based solely on the given

                        iridescence or any other form of light production or reflection.Iridescence
                        is a phenomenon where certain surfaces appear to change color as the angle

                        light.[3] This experimental form of illumination avoided the necessity of
                        using candles which risked sparking explosions of firedamp.[4] In 1920, the
                        American zoologist E. Newton Harvey published a monograph, The Nature of
                        Animal Light, summarizing early work on bioluminescence. Harvey notes that

                        production of light by living organisms through a biochemical reaction.
                        While both phenomena involve light, they are fundamentally different

                        Bioluminescence refers to the production and emission of light by a living
                        organism, which is the phenomenon Darwin is discussing when he refers to the
                        luminous jellyfish and the scintillation of the waves caused by what he
                        believes to be "minute crustacea." This is associated with organisms
                        emitting light, often seen in marine life.Iridescence, on the other hand, is
                        the phenomenon where certain surfaces appear to change color as the angle of
                        view or the angle of illumination changes. It's a physical property of
                        certain surfaces that results from the structure of the surface itself,
                        rather than from the emission of light by the organism.The snippet talks
                        about Darwin's observations regarding luminous marine life and his incorrect
                        hypothesis about its cause, mentioning phosphorescence (a type of

                    <paragraphText>The French pharmacologist Raphaël Dubois carried out work on
                        bioluminescence in the late nineteenth century. He studied click beetles
                        (Pyrophorus) and the marine bivalve mollusc Pholas dactylus. He refuted the
                        old idea that bioluminescence came from phosphorus,[13][a] and demonstrated
                        that the process was related to the oxidation of a specific compound, which
                        he named luciferin, by an enzyme.[15] He sent Harvey siphons from the
                        mollusc preserved in sugar. Harvey had become interested in bioluminescence
                        as a result of visiting the South Pacific and Japan and observing
                        phosphorescent organisms there. He studied the phenomenon for many years.
                        His research aimed to demonstrate that luciferin, and the enzymes that act
                        on it to produce light, were interchangeable between species, showing that
                        all bioluminescent organisms had a common ancestor. However, he found this
                        hypothesis to be false, with different organisms having major differences in
                        the composition of their light-producing proteins. He spent the next 30
                        years purifying and studying the components, but it fell to the young
                        Japanese chemist Osamu Shimomura to be the first to obtain crystalline

                        initially had other functions such as breaking down pigment molecules. It
                        discusses natural selection in deeper, darker waters and the possible
                        selective advantages of luminescence.Nowhere in the snippet is there any
                        reference to "iridescence," nor is there a comparison made between
                        bioluminescence and iridescence that would help to infer the RDF statement.
                        To validate the RDF statement, one would need information explicitly stating
                        or implying the differences between the two phenomena, such as definitions
                        or descriptions that contrast bioluminescence and iridescence. Since that is

                        deleterious reactive oxygen species (e.g. H2O2 and O2− ). The functional

                    <modelAnswer>The given RDF statement cannot be inferred from the provided
                        snippet. Here's why:The RDF statement ["Bioluminescence" - "different from"
                        - "iridescence"] expresses a categorical distinction between the two
                        phenomena of bioluminescence and iridescence. Bioluminescence is the
                        production and emission of light by a living organism, which is the topic
                        discussed in the snippet. Iridescence, on the other hand, is a different
                        optical phenomenon wherein objects, such as certain butterfly wings or
                        peacock feathers, appear to change color when seen from different angles due
                        to the physical structure of their surface causing light to be refracted and
                        produce different colors at different angles.The snippet provided discusses
                        the possible evolutionary origins of bioluminescence in oceanic organisms,
                        relating it to the need for antioxidant defense against reactive oxygen
                        species (ROS) rather than the phenomenon of iridescence. It does not mention
                        iridescence at all, nor does it provide information about what makes
                        bioluminescence different from iridescence or any other optical or
                        biological phenomena.Since the snippet does not discuss iridescence or draw
                        any comparison between bioluminescence and iridescence, we cannot infer that
                        bioluminescence is different from iridescence based on the provided text.
                        That statement is true in the context of biological definitions of the two
                        terms, but this inference is not supported by the content of the
                        snippet.</modelAnswer>

            <modelAnswer>The RDF statement in question is ["Bioluminescence" - "different from" -
                "iridescence"], which asserts that bioluminescence is different from
                iridescence.From the given snippet, there is explicit information about
                bioluminescence - it describes the chemical reaction that produces light in
                bioluminescent organisms, its evolutionary history, and various functions in
                different taxa. It also states that bioluminescence is a form of chemiluminescence
                where light energy is released by a chemical reaction.However, there is no mention
                of iridescence within the snippet. To infer that bioluminescence is different from
                iridescence, there must be a description or definition of iridescence to contrast it
                with bioluminescence. Since iridescence is not mentioned at all, the information
                provided is insufficient to conclusively infer the distinction between the two as
                stated in the RDF.Iridescence is a physical phenomenon characterized by the change
                of colors depending on the viewing angle, primarily due to the structural
                configuration of the surface of an object, not a chemical reaction, which
                fundamentally differs from bioluminescence. But without this contextual information
                present in the snippet, the RDF relationship cannot be explicitly inferred.The
                correct answer, based on the given snippet, is: No, the RDF statement
                ["Bioluminescence" - "different from" - "iridescence"] cannot be inferred from the
                given snippet as iridescence is not mentioned or described, thus not providing a

            <modelAnswer>The RDF statement cannot be directly inferred from the snippet because the
                snippet does not explicitly discuss the concept of "iridescence" nor does it compare
                it to "bioluminescence."The snippet thoroughly explains what bioluminescence is and
                gives multiple examples of how various organisms use it (for attractions of mates,
                defense mechanisms, communication, and mimicry). Bioluminescence, as described in
                the snippet, is the emission of light by a living organism as the result of a
                chemical reaction.Iridescence, on the other hand, is a physical phenomenon where
                surfaces appear to change color as the angle of view or the angle of illumination
                changes, typically found on items such as soap bubbles, butterfly wings, and
                seashells. It is caused by the interference of light reflected from multiple layers
                of surfaces.Since the snippet doesn't mention the concept of iridescence or compare
                it to bioluminescence, we cannot infer the given RDF statement from the provided

            <modelAnswer>Based on the information provided in the snippet, the RDF statement
                ["Bioluminescence" - "different from" - "iridescence"] can be
                inferred.Bioluminescence is described in the snippet as the biological ability to
                produce light through a chemical reaction within living organisms. Various aspects
                of bioluminescence are discussed, including its potential uses in lighting, its
                genetic underpinnings, and specific biological pathways involving ATP, luciferin,
                and other compounds that result in light production.Iridescence, on the other hand,
                is not mentioned in the snippet. However, because we have common knowledge about
                iridescence – it is the phenomenon where certain surfaces appear to change color as
                the angle of view or the angle of illumination changes, and it is a physical
                characteristic caused by the structural composition of surfaces – we know that it is
                indeed different from bioluminescence. While bioluminescence is an active
                light-producing biological process, iridescence is a passive optical phenomenon that
                does not involve light production but rather the reflection, refraction, or
                diffraction of light.Since the RDF statement is confirming that bioluminescence is
                different from iridescence, and we know these two phenomena are fundamentally
                distinct based on their definitions and mechanisms, the statement can be inferred as
                accurate even though the snippet does not explicitly mention iridescence. The lack
                of any mention of iridescence in the context of light production by biological
                organisms further confirms that bioluminescence is indeed a separate
                process.</modelAnswer>

                        Engineered bioluminescence could perhaps one day be used to reduce the need
                        for street lighting, or for decorative purposes if it becomes possible to
                        produce light that is both bright enough and can be sustained for long

                        purpose.[93][94] They used the bioluminescent bacterium Aliivibrio fischeri,
                        but the maximum lifetime of their product was three days.[92] In April 2020,
                        plants were genetically engineered to glow more brightly using genes from
                        the bioluminescent mushroom Neonothopanus nambi to convert caffeic acid into
