                     statement is: ["Václav Havel" - "date of burial or cremation" -
                     "2011-12-23T00:00:00Z"].The relevant part of the snippet providing this information
                     is:"Prime Minister Petr Nečas announced a three-day mourning period from 21 to 23
                     December, the date announced by President Václav Klaus for the state funeral. ...
                     During the service, a 21 gun salute was fired in the former president's honour, and
                     in accordance with the family's request, a private ceremony followed at Prague's
                     Strašnice Crematorium. Havel's ashes were placed in the family tomb in the Vinohrady
                     Cemetery in Prague."This excerpt indicates that Václav Havel's cremation and the
                     placement of his ashes occurred in conjunction with the state funeral events
                     scheduled to conclude on 23 December 2011. We can infer from the information that
                     the cremation ("a private ceremony followed at Prague's Strašnice Crematorium") took
                     place on or before this date, resulting in the placement of his ashes in the family
                     tomb. Hence, the RDF statement correctly reflects that Václav Havel's cremation
                     happened on or by "2011-12-23T00:00:00Z". The actual date of the cremation might be
                     on or before the 23rd of December, but the RDF statement matches the latest possible
                     date given in the snippet.</td>

                     snippet.The snippet states that "...a private ceremony followed at Prague's
                     Strašnice Crematorium." This indicates that Václav Havel was cremated.
                     Furthermore, the snippet mentions "Prime Minister Petr Nečas announced a
                     three-day mourning period from 21 to 23 December, the date announced by
                     President Václav Klaus for the state funeral." This tells us that the state
                     funeral took place by the end of this mourning period, on December 23,
                     2011.Combined, these pieces of information let us know that Havel's
                     cremation took place on or before December 23, 2011, which corresponds with
                     the date provided in the RDF statement, "2011-12-23T00:00:00Z". Given that
                     this is the date of the state funeral and the private ceremony at the

                     the cremation did not occur after this date.Thus, it is accurate to infer
                     that Václav Havel's date of burial or cremation was 2011-12-23 based on the

                     mention anything about Havel's death, burial, or cremation. It instead talks
                     about the unveiling of a bust in his honor at the U.S. Congress in 2014 and
                     the presence of his sculpture in Leinster House in Dublin. Neither of these
                     events is related to the date of his burial or cremation.Without additional
                     information connecting these events to the burial or cremation date, we

                     supply the required information about his death or related
