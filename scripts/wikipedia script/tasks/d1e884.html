                     snippet mentions that "On 23 April 2017, Macron received the most votes in the first
                     round of the presidential election." This implies that Macron was a candidate in the
                     presidential election. Additionally, it is mentioned that Macron "won the second
                     round of the presidential election on 7 May 2017" and "was elected President of
                     France with 66.1% of the vote." These statements confirm that Macron was successful
                     in the presidential election.Given that the Charlemagne Prize is awarded for work
                     done in the service of European unification, the inference can be made that Macron,
                     as the President of France, would have been a potential candidate for such an award
                     due to his role in governance and leadership within the European
                     context.</td>
