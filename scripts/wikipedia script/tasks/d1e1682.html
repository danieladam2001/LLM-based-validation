                     received the award "Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece."- The snippet
                     mentions that Schwarzenberg was a patron of The English College in Prague
                     and that he was a joint patron with King Charles; however, it does not
                     mention any awards or honors, specifically nothing about "Knight of the
                     Order of the Golden Fleece."- Being a patron or succeeding another patron
                     (in this case, Vaclav Havel) is not directly related to receiving an award
                     or honor; hence, one cannot infer that Schwarzenberg received the mentioned
                     award from the information about his role as a patron.- The snippet does not
                     provide any details on Schwarzenberg's awards or distinctions that could
                     relate to the RDF statement.Thus, the given RDF cannot be substantiated by
                     the information in the snippet. More information would be needed to confirm
                     if Karel Schwarzenberg has received the award "Knight of the Order of the

                     discusses Schwarzenberg's political stance regarding the denial of communist
