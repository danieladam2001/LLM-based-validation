                  <td class="generalInfoCell">The RDF statement cannot be inferred from the given snippet.Reasoning:The
                     snippet explicitly states, "In August 2015, Macron said that he was no longer a
                     member of the Socialist Party and was an independent."[51] This sentence indicates
                     that Emmanuel Macron identified himself as an independent politician, which supports
                     the RDF statement given ("Emmanuel Macron" - "member of political party" -
                     "independent politician").However, the RDF is considering "independent politician"
                     as a political party membership, which is incorrect. Being an independent politician
                     means that the person is not a member of any political party. Therefore, while the
                     snippet does say Macron was an independent, this should not be deduced as him being
                     a member of an "independent political party," as the concept of being an independent
                     directly contradicts party membership.Thus, the correct RDF representation of the
                     information provided would be simply that Emmanuel Macron is an independent
                     politician, not associated with any particular political party at the time stated
                     in
                     the snippet.</td>
