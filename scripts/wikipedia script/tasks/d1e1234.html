                  <td class="generalInfoCell">No, the given RDF statement cannot be inferred from the given
                     snippet.Reasoning: The snippet provides information about Karel
                     Schwarzenberg's political stance regarding the criminalization of the denial
                     of communist crimes in the European Union, comparing it to the denial of
                     Nazi crimes, which is already a criminal offense in many EU countries.
                     However, it does not mention Schwarzenberg receiving any awards or prizes,
                     let alone specifically the "European Human Rights Prize." Therefore, based
                     on the provided text, the inference that Karel Schwarzenberg has received
                     the "European Human Rights Prize" is not supported.</td>
