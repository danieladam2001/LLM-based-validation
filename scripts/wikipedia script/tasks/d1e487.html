                     leader and co-founder of the TOP 09 political party, it is implicit that he
                     was also a member of this party. Additionally, in political contexts, being
                     the leader of a political party presupposes membership in that party.
                     Therefore, this information directly supports the RDF statement that Karel

                     mention the political party "TOP 09" or any political party affiliations of
                     Karel Schwarzenberg. The snippet focuses on Schwarzenberg's activities in
                     the resistance against the communist dictatorship in Czechoslovakia, his
                     role in human rights advocacy, and his leadership in various organizations
                     aimed at promoting human rights and Czechoslovakian literature. It mentions
                     his chairmanship of the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights
                     and the foundation of the Dokumentationszentrum, but it does not provide

                     explicitly states Schwarzenberg's membership in the political party "TOP

                     Miroslav Kalousek in 2009. The act of forming a party implies membership, as
                     one would typically be considered a member of a political party that they
                     have co-founded. Furthermore, the snippet states that they led this party to
                     success in the general elections of 2010, which reinforces the idea that
                     Schwarzenberg was not just a founder but an active member and leader of the
                     TOP 09 party.Therefore, it can be concluded that "Karel Schwarzenberg" was a

                     the given snippet. Reasoning: The snippet mentions "čestný

                     "honorary chairman of TOP 09." This implies that Karel
                     Schwarzenberg is associated with the political party TOP 09,
                     having a prominent role within it. The RDF statement
                     indicates that "Karel Schwarzenberg" is a "member of
                     political party" "TOP 09." The fact that he is described as
                     an honorary chairman of the party indicates that he is
                     indeed a member of this party, allowing us to infer the RDF
