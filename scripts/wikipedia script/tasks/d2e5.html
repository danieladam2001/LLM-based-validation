                     "Civic Forum" through the predicate "member of political party." Therefore, based
                     on

                     Restored Vladimir Tismaneanu (bio) The 1989 revolutions in
                     Central and Eastern Europe signaled the demise of the
                     communist bloc. They represent the triumph of civic dignity
                     and political morality over ideological monism, bureaucratic
                     cynicism, and police-state dictatorship. Their significance
                     cannot be overestimated. The ousting of communist rule
                     across the region that began that year irrevocably altered
                     the geopolitical landscape. But it also gave rise to a
                     potentially dangerous situation, as the absence of norms and
                     predictable rational behavior in the postcommunist states
                     conceivably could have led to global chaos. This is not to
                     wax nostalgic for the Cold War–era world order, but simply
                     to point out that the end of Leninism and the fall of the
                     Iron Curtain created a radically novel situation. It in no
                     way diminishes the triumph of 1989 to acknowledge that
                     ethnic rivalries, rampant political and economic corruption,
                     and the rise of illiberal political parties and movements as
                     well as collectivist and nativist trends have afflicted much
                     of the postcommunist world since then. Understanding the
                     repercussions of "the upheaval in the East," however, will
                     help us better to grasp the meaning of ongoing debates about
                     liberalism, socialism, nationalism, civil society, and the
                     very notion of human freedom in the aftermath of a most
                     atrocious century.1 After 1989, Central and Eastern Europe
                     had to make the transition from Leninist pseudomodernization
                     to genuine modernity. This was no simple task, for at the
                     root of most postcommunist problems lay the misdevelopment
                     of society under Leninism. As Tony Judt noted, "seventy [End
                     Page 128] years of energetic claims to the contrary
                     notwithstanding . . . there was indeed no Communist society
                     as such: only a wilting state and its anxious citizens."2 At
                     the beginning of the 1990s, I argued that the leading cause
                     of communism's collapse was the resurrection and development
                     of civil society.3 Absent an active civil society, the
                     revolutions of 1989 would have been replaced, at best, by a
                     so-called enlightened despotism. With the end of state
                     socialism came the crucial task of restoring the social glue
                     that had been dissolved by the endemic corruption and moral
                     disarray that plagued these societies. Caught up in the
                     romance of revolutionary excitement, most observers glossed
                     over the diversity of the anticommunist movements. Not
                     everyone who rejected Leninism did so because he or she was
                     dreaming of an open society founded on liberal values. Among
                     the revolutionaries were populist fundamentalists, religious
                     zealots, and those who longed for the return of the
                     undemocratic precommunist regimes. It was only after the
                     disintegration of Yugoslavia and the "velvet divorce"
                     between the Czechs and Slovaks that scholars and policy
                     makers began to realize that the liberal promise of these
                     revolutions could not be taken for granted and that
                     communism would not necessarily be followed by liberal
                     democracy. In the early 1990s, it became unmistakably clear
                     that the postcommunist era was fraught with all manner of
                     threats, as much of the region descended into bloody ethnic
                     conflict and social unrest, and saw the infectious rise of
                     old and new kinds of populism and tribalism.4 Nowhere were
                     the perils of postcommunism more evident than in the
                     Balkans, where democratic values completely shattered under
                     ethnocratic pressure soon after communism fell. The wars of
                     secession in Yugoslavia proved to be Eastern Europe's
                     paradigmatic worst-case scenario. In the former Yugoslav
                     federation, we witnessed what I once called the "Belgrade
                     syndrome," a form of populism instrumentalized through
                     militaristic, expansionist policies and demagogic
                     nationalism. Its purpose was to preserve the political
                     domination of the ex-communist, radically nationalist elite
                     that was loyal to Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević, whose
                     personalistic, ethnocentric, and authoritarian regime rested
                     on the ruling Socialist Party, secret police, and army. This
                     type of politics was not ideological; it was neither left
                     nor right. Rather, policies were adopted only in accord with
                     the needs and whims of the power holders. Elites deployed
                     nationalistic, manipulative political slogans with utter
                     disregard for their long-term consequences. The popularity
                     and manifestation of this genre of "government"
                     (identifiable to varying degrees at the time in such
                     countries as Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Romania, and
                     Slovakia) in the first decade of postcommunism seemed... </td>

                     of Communist normalization. In 1975 he wrote an open letter
                     to President Husak in which he drew attention to the
                     accumulation of conflicts in Czechoslovak society. However,

                     a&nbsp;section of Czechoslovak citizens. Vaclav Havel was one of
                     the founding members of this initiative and one of the first
                     three spokespersons. In April 1979 he was one of the

                     of the closing down of Czech Universities by the Nazis in
                     1939.&nbsp;On November 17, 1989, the Communist regime brutally
                     suppressed the students by ordering the police to charge
                     against the students on Prague's Narodni trida (National
                     Blvd in Prague's centre). Students and the artist community
                     subsequently headed the civic protest movement. An assembly
                     convened in the Cinoherni klub ("Drama Club") on November 19
                     established the Civic Forum which united individuals and
                     groups who called for fundamental political changes in
                     Czechoslovakia. From the very beginning Vaclav Havel became
                     its leading representative. The social upheaval then came to
                     a&nbsp;climax on December 29, 1989 when Vaclav Havel as
                     a&nbsp;candidate of the Civic Forum was elected Czechoslovak
                     President by the Federal Assembly. In his inauguration
                     address he made a&nbsp;pledge to lead the country toward free
                     elections, which he fulfilled in the summer of 1990.&nbsp;The new
                     Federal Assembly elected Vaclav Havel for a&nbsp;second term in
                     office as President on July 5, 1990.</td>

                     "member of political party" - "Civic Forum".- Being the leader of a
                     political party implies being a member of that political party.- Therefore,
                     based on the information provided in the snippet, it can be inferred that

                     mention his association with the political party "Civic
