                     confirms that Karel Schwarzenberg was married to Countess Therese von Hardegg, which
                     implies that she is his spouse. Additionally, the snippet also mentions:"On 22 April
                     1967, in Seefeld, Schwarzenberg married Countess Therese zu Hardegg [...] The couple
                     married for a second time on 25 July 2008."This further validates the RDF statement
                     by providing information that not only were they married, but they also remarried,
                     reaffirming the spouse relationship between Karel Schwarzenberg and Therese
                     Schwarzenberg (here referred to as Countess Therese zu Hardegg, indicating her

                     Karel Schwarzenberg, mentioning his roles as a politician, diplomat, and
                     statesman in the Czech Republic, his positions as Minister of Foreign

                     Gräfin zu Hardegg auf Glatz und im Machlande)"; this establishes the marital
                     relationship between Schwarzenberg and Countess Therese. In an RDF
                     statement, the subject is "Karel Schwarzenberg," the predicate is "spouse,"

                     maiden name "Countess Therese von Hardegg," it also introduces her as
                     Therese, showing that "Therese Schwarzenberg" refers to the same individual
                     as "Countess Therese von Hardegg."The reasoning is based on the relationship
                     described in the snippet (marriage), the common given name "Therese," and
                     the context that indicates Countess Therese was married to a Schwarzenberg,
                     thus after marriage, her last name can be inferred to be

                     on the snippet provided:- Karel Schwarzenberg married Countess Therese zu

                     Therese zu Hardegg is the person he married.- Although the marriage ended in
                     divorce in 1988, they remarried on 25 July 2008.- The snippet refers to
                     Countess Therese zu Hardegg as "His wife," indicating that at the time of
                     the referenced events, or at least at the time the snippet was written,
                     Therese was (or is again) Schwarzenberg's wife.From this information, we can
                     conclude that "Karel Schwarzenberg" has the role of "spouse" to "Therese
                     Schwarzenberg" (who is also known as Countess Therese zu Hardegg). Although
                     the snippet does not use the last name Schwarzenberg for Therese, it is
                     common for a wife to take her husband's surname in many traditions. Since
                     the snippet references their marriage, the RDF statement that Karel

                     foreign ministers of five other Central and Eastern European EU countries,
                     called upon the European Commission to make "the approval, denial or
                     belittening of communist crimes" an EU-wide criminal offence. Schwarzenberg
                     said that the denial of the crimes of communism is analogous to denying the

                     information about Karel Schwarzenberg's political stance regarding the
                     treatment of communist crimes in the EU. It discusses his call for EU-wide
                     criminalization of the denial of such crimes. However, there is no mention
                     of any personal relationships or his marital status in the snippet.
                     Information about Karel Schwarzenberg having a spouse named Therese
