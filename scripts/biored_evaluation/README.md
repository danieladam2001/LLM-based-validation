# Script for adjusted BioRED evaluation
We used BioRED dataset for our evaluation available at: https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/23/5/bbac282/6645993.
We made adjustments to be able to perform a verification task on this dataset. Details about the adjustments are described in detail in our paper.
The results of the evaluation are saved into /biored-tests which is automatically created at the start of the process.
Each combination of concepts, relation types and scenarios (positive/negative use-case) are then saved into a separate folder.
The result is in JSON format.
