                <groupText> President (2017–present) Minister of Economy and Industry (2014–2016)
                    Renaissance Emmanuel Jean-Michel Frédéric Macron (French: [emanɥɛl makʁɔ̃]; born
                    21 December 1977) is a French politician who has been President of France since
                    2017. Macron is ex officio one of the two Co-Princes of Andorra. He previously
                    was Minister of Economics, Industry and Digital Affairs under President François
                    Hollande from 2014 to 2016, and as Deputy Secretary-General to the President
                    from 2012 to 2014. He is a founding member of Renaissance, a centrist political
                    party. Born in Amiens, Macron studied philosophy at Paris Nanterre University,
                    later completing a master's degree in public affairs at Sciences Po and
                    graduating from the École nationale d'administration in 2004. He worked as a
                    senior civil servant at the Inspectorate General of Finances and later became an
                    investment banker at Rothschild &amp;amp; Co. Appointed Élysée deputy
                    secretary-general by President François Hollande shortly after his election in
                    May 2012, Macron was one of Hollande's senior advisers. Appointed Minister of
                    Economics, Industry and Digital Affairs in August 2014 in the second Valls
                    government, he led a number of business-friendly reforms. He resigned in August
                    2016, in order to launch his 2017 presidential campaign. A member of the
                    Socialist Party from 2006 to 2009, he ran in the election under the banner of En
                    Marche, a centrist and pro-European political movement he founded in April 2016.
                    Partly as a result of the Fillon affair which sank the Republican nominee
                    François Fillon's chances, Macron topped the ballot in the first round of
                    voting, and was elected President of France on 7 May 2017 with 66.1% of the vote
                    in the second round, defeating Marine Le Pen of the National Front. At the age
                    of 39, he became the youngest president in French history. In the 2017
                    legislative election in June, his party, renamed La République En Marche!
                    (LREM), secured a majority in the National Assembly. He appointed Édouard
                    Philippe as prime minister. When Philippe resigned in 2020, Macron appointed
                    Jean Castex to replace him. Macron was elected to a second term in the 2022
                    presidential election, again defeating Le Pen, thus becoming the first French
                    presidential candidate to win reelection since Jacques Chirac defeated
                    Jean-Marie Le Pen in 2002. However, in the 2022 legislative election, his
                    centrist coalition lost its absolute majority, resulting in a hung parliament
                    and the formation of France's first minority government since the fall of the
                    Bérégovoy government in 1993. Macron's current prime minister is Gabriel Attal,
                    youngest head of government in French history and first openly gay man to hold
                    the office, whom he appointed in January 2024 to replace Élisabeth Borne, the
                    second female Prime Minister of France, after a major government crisis. During
                    his presidency, Macron has overseen several reforms to labour laws, taxation,
                    and pensions; and has pursued a renewable energy transition. Dubbed "president
                    of the rich" by political opponents, increasing protests against his domestic
                    reforms and demanding his resignation marked the first years of his presidency,
                    culminating in 2018–2020 with the yellow vests protests and the pension reform
                    strike. From 2020, he led France's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and
                    vaccination rollout. In 2023, the government of his prime minister, Élisabeth
                    Borne, passed legislation raising the retirement age from 62 to 64; the pension
                    reforms proved controversial and led to public sector strikes and violent
                    protests. In foreign policy, he called for reforms to the European Union (EU)
                    and signed bilateral treaties with Italy and Germany. Macron conducted €42
                    billion in trade and business agreements with China during the China–United
                    States trade war and oversaw a dispute with Australia and the United States over
                    the AUKUS security pact. He continued Opération Chammal in the war against the
                    Islamic State and joined in the international condemnation of the Russian
                    invasion of Ukraine. Macron was born on 21 December 1977 in Amiens. He is the
                    son of Françoise Macron (née Noguès), a physician, and Jean-Michel Macron,
                    professor of neurology at the University of Picardy.[1][2] The couple divorced
                    in 2010. He has two siblings, Laurent, born in 1979, and Estelle, born in 1982.
                    Françoise and Jean-Michel's first child was stillborn.[3] The Macron family
                    legacy is traced back to the village of Authie, Picardy.[4] One of his paternal
                    great-grandfathers, George William Robertson, was English, and was born in
                    Bristol, United Kingdom.[5][6] His maternal grandparents, Jean and Germaine
                    Noguès (née Arribet), are from the Pyrenean town of Bagnères-de-Bigorre,
                    Gascony.[7] He commonly visited Bagnères-de-Bigorre to visit his grandmother
                    Germaine, whom he called "Manette".[8] Macron associates his enjoyment of
                    reading[9] and his leftward political leanings to Germaine, who, after coming
                    from a modest upbringing of a stationmaster father and a housekeeping mother,
                    became a teacher then a principal, and died in 2013.[10] Although raised in a
                    non-religious family, Macron was baptised a Catholic at his own request at age
                    12; he is agnostic today.[11] Macron was educated mainly at the Jesuit institute
                    Lycée la Providence[12] in Amiens[13] before his parents sent him to finish his
                    last year of school[14] at the elite Lycée Henri-IV in Paris, where he completed
                    the high school curriculum and the undergraduate program with a "Bac S, Mention
                    Très bien". At the same time, he was nominated for the "Concours général" (most
                    selective national level high school competition) in French literature and
                    received his diploma for his piano studies at Amiens Conservatory.[15] His
                    parents sent him to Paris due to their alarm at the bond he had formed with
                    Brigitte Auzière, a married teacher with three children at Jésuites de la
                    Providence, who later became his wife.[16] In Paris, Macron twice failed to gain
                    entry to the École normale supérieure.[17][18][19] He instead studied philosophy
                    at the University of Paris-Ouest Nanterre La Défense, obtaining a DEA degree (a
                    master level degree), with a thesis on Machiavelli and Hegel.[12][20] Around
                    1999 Macron worked as an editorial assistant to Paul Ricoeur, the French
                    Protestant philosopher who was then writing his last major work, La Mémoire,
                    l'Histoire, l'Oubli. Macron worked mainly on the notes and bibliography.[21][22]
                    Macron became a member of the editorial board of the literary magazine
                    Esprit.[23] Macron did not perform national service because he was pursuing his
                    graduate studies. Born in December 1977, he belonged to the last cohort for whom
                    military service was mandatory.[24][25] Macron obtained a master's degree in
                    public affairs at Sciences Po, majoring in "Public Guidance and Economy" before
                    training for a senior civil service career at the selective École nationale
                    d'administration (ENA), training at the French Embassy in Nigeria[26] and at the
                    prefecture of Oise before graduating in 2004.[27] After graduating from ENA in
                    2004, Macron became an Inspector in the Inspection générale des finances (IGF),
                    a branch of the Finance Ministry.[21] Macron was mentored by Jean-Pierre Jouyet,
                    the then-head of the IGF.[28] During his time as an Inspector of Finances,
                    Macron gave lectures during the summer at the "prep'ENA" (a special cram school
                    for the ENA entrance examination) at IPESUP, an elite private school
                    specializing in preparation for the entrance examinations of the Grandes écoles,
                    such as HEC or Sciences Po.[29][30][31] In 2006, Laurence Parisot offered him
                    the job of managing director for Mouvement des Entreprises de France, the
                    largest employer federation in France, but he declined.[32] In August 2007,
                    Macron was appointed deputy rapporteur for Jacques Attali's "Commission to
                    Unleash French Growth".[13] In 2008, Macron paid €50,000 to buy himself out of
                    his government contract.[33] He then became an investment banker in a
                    highly-paid position at Rothschild &amp;amp; Cie Banque.[34][35] In March 2010, he
                    was appointed to the Attali Commission as a member.[36] In September 2008,
                    Macron left his job as an Inspector of Finances and took a position at
                    Rothschild &amp;amp; Cie Banque.[37] Macron left the government when Nicolas Sarkozy
                    became president. He was originally offered the job by François Henrot. His
                    first responsibility at the bank was assisting with the acquisition of Cofidis
                    by Crédit Mutuel Nord Europe.[38] Macron formed a relationship with Alain Minc,
                    a businessman on the supervisory board of Le Monde.[39] In 2010, Macron was
                    promoted to partner with the bank after working on the recapitalization of Le
                    Monde and the acquisition by Atos of Siemens IT Solutions and Services.[40] In
                    the same year, Macron was put in charge of Nestlé's acquisition of Pfizer's
                    infant nutrition division for €9 billion, which made him a millionaire.[41][42]
                    In February 2012, Macron advised businessman Philippe Tillous-Borde, the CEO of
                    the Avril Group.[43] Macron reported that he had earned €2 million between
                    December 2010 and May 2012.[44] Official documents show that between 2009 and
                    2013, Macron had earned almost €3 million.[45] He left Rothschild &amp;amp; Cie in
                    2012.[46][47] In his youth, Macron worked for the Citizen and Republican
                    Movement for two years, but he never applied to be a member.[48][44] Macron was
                    an assistant for Mayor Georges Sarre of the 11th arrondissement of Paris during
                    his time at Sciences Po.[49] Macron had been a member of the Socialist Party
                    since he was 24,[50] but last renewed his membership for the period
                    2006–2009.[51] </groupText>

                <groupText>Macron met François Hollande through Jean-Pierre Jouyet in 2006 and
                    joined his staff in 2010.[50] In 2007, Macron attempted to run for a seat in the
                    National Assembly in Picardy under the Socialist Party label in the 2007
                    legislative elections; however, his application was declined.[52] Macron was
                    offered the chance to be the deputy chief of staff to Prime Minister François
                    Fillon in 2010, though he declined.[53] On 15 May 2012, Macron became the deputy
                    secretary-general of the Élysée, a senior role in President François Hollande's
                    staff.[54][27] Macron served with Nicolas Revel. He served under the
                    secretary-general, Pierre-René Lemas. During the summer of 2012, Macron put
                    forward a proposal that would increase the 35-hour work week to 37 hours until
                    2014. He also tried to hold back the large tax increases on the highest earners
                    that were planned by the government. Hollande refused Macron's proposals.[55] In
                    2013, his was one of the deciding votes against regulating the salaries of
                    CEOs.[56] Nicolas Revel, the other deputy secretary-general of the Élysée
                    opposed Macron on a proposed budget responsibility pact favoured by the
                    Medef.[57] On 10 June 2014, it was announced that Macron had resigned from his
                    role and was replaced by Laurence Boone.[58] Reasons given for his departure
                    included his disappointment at not being included in the first Government of
                    Manuel Valls and his frustration with his lack of influence on the reforms
                    proposed by the government.[57] This was following the appointment of
                    Jean-Pierre Jouyet as chief of staff.[59] Jouyet said that Macron left to
                    "continue personal aspirations"[60] and create his own financial consultancy
                    firm.[61] It was later reported that he was planning to create an investment
                    firm that would attempt to fund educational projects.[48] Shortly afterwards he
                    was hired as a research fellow at the University of Berlin with the help of
                    businessman Alain Minc. He had also sought a position at Harvard University.[62]
                    Offered a chance to be a candidate in the municipal elections in 2014 in his
                    hometown of Amiens, Macron declined,[63] leading François Hollande to reject
                    Manuel Valls's idea of appointing him Budget Minister, as he had never been
                    elected to public office.[59] He was appointed as the Minister of Economics and
                    Industry in the second Valls Cabinet on 26 August 2014, replacing Arnaud
                    Montebourg.[64] He was the youngest Minister of Economics since Valéry Giscard
                    d'Estaing in 1962.[65] Macron was branded by the media as the "Anti-Montebourg"
                    due to being pro-EU and much more moderate, while Montebourg was eurosceptic and
                    left-wing.[66] As Minister of Economics, Macron was at the forefront of pushing
                    through business-friendly reforms. On 17 February 2015, prime minister Manuel
                    Valls pushed Macron's signature law package through a reluctant parliament using
                    the special 49.3 procedure.[67] Macron increased the French share in the company
                    Renault from 15% to 20% and then enforced the Florange law which grants double
                    voting rights on shares registered for more than two years unless two-thirds of
                    shareholders vote to overturn it.[68] This gave the French state a minority
                    share in the company though Macron later stated that the government would limit
                    its powers within Renault.[69] Macron was widely criticized for being unable to
                    prevent the closing down of an Ecopla factory in Isère.[70] In August 2015,
                    Macron said that he was no longer a member of the Socialist Party and was an
                    independent.[51] A law which had originally been sponsored by Arnaud Montebourg
                    before he left the government, and which had focused on "purchasing power", grew
                    into the Macron law [fr], a grab bag of measures liberalizing laws prohibiting
                    work on Sunday and at night; restrictions on coaches for public transportation;
                    regulations for debt collectors, barristers and auctioneers; and rules governing
                    the rental of equipment by the military from private companies. The law also
                    sought to simplify many government procedures, such as that for obtaining a
                    driving licence.[71][72] Manuel Valls, fearing that it would not pass in the
                    National Assembly, decided to push the law through with the 49.3
                    procedure[73][67] and so it was adopted on 10 April 2015.[74] Estimates of the
                    increase in GDP the law might generate ranged from 0.3% to 0.5%.[75][76] Macron
                    first became known to the French public after his appearance on the French TV
                    programme Des Paroles Et Des Actes in March 2015.[77] Before forming his
                    political party En Marche!, he gave a number of speeches, his first one in March
                    2015 in Val-de-Marne.[78] He threatened to leave Manuel Valls' second government
                    over the proposed removal of dual-nationality from terrorists.[79][80] He also
                    took various foreign trips, including one to Israel where he spoke on the
                    advancement of digital technology.[81] Tensions around the question of Macron's
                    loyalty to the Valls government and Hollande increased when they turned down a
                    bill he put forward dubbed "Macron 2", which had a larger scope than his
                    original law.[82][83] Macron was given the chance to help draft into the El
                    Khomri law and put specific parts of "Macron 2" into the law though El Khomri
                    was able to overturn these with the help of other ministers.[citation
                    needed][clarification needed] Amid tensions and deterioration of relations with
                    the current government, Macron founded an independent political party, En
                    Marche, in Amiens on 6 April 2016.[84] A liberal,[85] progressive[86][87]
                    political movement that gathered huge media coverage when it was first
                    established,[88] the party and Macron were both reprimanded by President
                    Hollande and the question of Macron's loyalty to the government was
                    raised.[89][90] Several MEPs spoke out in support for the movement[91] though
                    the majority of the Socialist Party spoke against En Marche including Manuel
                    Valls,[92] Michel Sapin,[93] Axelle Lemaire and Christian Eckert.[94] In June
                    2016, support for Macron and his movement, En Marche, began to grow in the media
                    with Libération reporting that L'Express, Les Échos, Le 1 [fr], and L'Opinion
                    had begun to support him.[95] Following several controversies surrounding trade
                    unionists and their protests, Acrimed [fr] reported that major newspapers began
                    to run front-page stories about Macron and En Marche.[96] Criticized by both the
                    far-left and the far-right, these pro-Macron influencers in the press were
                    dubbed "Macronites".[97][98] In May 2016, Orleans mayor Olivier Carré invited
                    Macron to the festival commemorating the 587th anniversary of Joan of Arc's
                    efforts during the Siege of Orléans.[99][100] LCI reported that Macron was
                    trying to take back the symbol of Joan of Arc from the far-right.[101] Macron
                    later went to Puy du Fou and declared he was "not a socialist" in a speech amid
                    rumours he was going to leave the current government.[102] On 30 August 2016,
                    Macron resigned from the government ahead of the 2017 presidential
                    election,[103][104] to devote himself to his En Marche movement.[105][106] There
                    had been rising tensions and several reports that he had wanted to leave the
                    Valls government since early 2015.[107] He initially planned to leave after the
                    cancellation[clarification needed] of his "Macron 2" law[83] but decided to stay
                    on temporarily after a meeting with President François Hollande.[108] Michel
                    Sapin was announced as Macron's replacement,[109] while Hollande said he felt
                    Macron had "methodically betrayed" him.[110] An IFOP poll showed that 84% of
                    those surveyed agreed with his decision to resign.[111] Macron first showed his
                    intention to run by forming En Marche, but following his resignation from the
                    government, he was able to dedicate more time to his movement. He first
                    announced that he was considering running for president in April 2016,[112] and
                    after his resignation from the position of economy minister, media sources began
                    to identify patterns in his fundraising indicating he would run.[113] In October
                    2016, Macron criticized Hollande's goal of being a "normal" president, saying
                    that France needed a more "Jupiterian presidency".[114] On 16 November 2016,
                    Macron formally declared his candidacy for the French presidency after months of
                    speculation. In his announcement speech, he called for a "democratic revolution"
                    and promised to "unblock France".[115] He had expressed hope that Hollande would
                    run several months earlier, saying that—as the sitting president—he was the
                    legitimate Socialist party candidate.[116][117] Macron's book Révolution was
                    published on 24 November 2016 and reached fifth position on the French
                    best-seller list in December 2016.[118] Shortly after announcing his run,
                    Jean-Christophe Cambadélis and Manuel Valls both asked Macron to run in the
                    Socialist Party presidential primary, which he ultimately refused to
                    do.[119][120] Jean-Christophe Cambadélis began to threaten to exclude members
                    who associated or supported Macron following Lyon mayor Gérard Collomb throwing
                    his support behind him.[121] </groupText>

                <groupText>Macron's campaign, headed by French economist Sophie Ferracci,[122]
                    announced in December 2016 that it had raised 3.7 million euros in
                    donations,[123] three times the budget of then-front runner Alain Juppé.[124]
                    Macron came under criticism from several individuals, including Benoît Hamon−who
                    requested he reveal a list of his donors and accused him of conflicts of
                    interest due to the time he spent at Rothschilds,[125] which Macron dismissed as
                    "demagogy".[126] Journalists Marion L'Hour and Frédéric Says later reported that
                    he had spent €120,000 on setting up dinners and meetings with various
                    personalities within the media and in French popular culture while at
                    Bercy.[127] Christian Jacob and Philippe Vigier accused him of using this money
                    to campaign without campaigning.[128] His successor, Michel Sapin, saw nothing
                    illegal about his actions, saying that he had the right to spend the funds.[129]
                    Macron called the allegations "defamatory" and said that none of the ministerial
                    budget had been spent on his party.[127] Macron's campaign enjoyed considerable
                    coverage from the media.[130] Mediapart reported that over fifty magazine covers
                    were dedicated purely to him.[131] Friends with the owners of Le Monde[132] and
                    Claude Perdiel, the former owner of Nouvel Observateur,[133] he was labelled the
                    "media candidate" by the far-left and far-right and was viewed as such in
                    opinion polls.[134][135][136] Many observers compared his campaign to a product
                    being sold[137] due to Maurice Lévy, a former Publicis CEO, using marketing
                    tactics to try to advance his presidential ambitions.[138][139] The magazine
                    Marianne reported that BFM TV, owned by Patrick Drahi, broadcast more coverage
                    of Macron than of all the other main candidates combined.[140] Marianne
                    speculated that this might be due to the campaigns links with Drahi through
                    Bernard Mourad.[141][142] François Bayrou, with whom Macron had been compared,
                    announced he was not going to stand in the presidential election and instead
                    formed an electoral alliance with Macron,[143][144] whose poll ratings began to
                    rise. After several legal issues surrounding François Fillon were publicized,
                    Macron overtook him in the polls to become the front-runner.[145][146] Macron
                    attracted criticism for the time taken to spell out a formal program during his
                    campaign; despite declaring in November that he had still not released a
                    complete set of proposals by February, attracting both attacks from critics and
                    concern among allies and supporters.[147] He eventually laid out his 150-page
                    formal program on 2 March, publishing it online and discussing it at a marathon
                    press conference that day.[148] Macron accumulated a wide array of supporters,
                    securing endorsements from François Bayrou of the Democratic Movement (MoDem),
                    MEP Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the ecologist candidate François de Rugy of the primary
                    of the left, and Socialist MP Richard Ferrand, secretary-general of En Marche,
                    as well as numerous others – many of them from the Socialist Party, but also a
                    significant number of centrist and centre-right politicians.[149] The Grand
                    Mosque of Paris urged French Muslims to vote en masse for Macron.[150] On 23
                    April 2017, Macron received the most votes in the first round of the
                    presidential election, with more than 8 million votes (24%) and faced Marine Le
                    Pen in the second round, with the support of former candidates François Fillon
                    and Benoît Hamon[151] and the sitting president François Hollande.[152] Many
                    foreign politicians supported Macron in his bid against right-wing populist
                    candidate Marine Le Pen, including European Commission President Jean-Claude
                    Juncker, German Chancellor Angela Merkel,[153] and former US President Barack
                    Obama.[154] A debate was arranged between Macron and Le Pen on 3 May 2017. The
                    debate lasted for two hours and opinion polls showed that he was perceived to
                    have won.[155] In March 2017, Macron's digital campaign manager, Mounir
                    Mahjoubi, told Britain's Sky News that Russia is behind "high level attacks" on
                    Macron, and said that its state media are "the first source of false
                    information". He said: "We are accusing RT (formerly known as Russia Today) and
                    Sputnik News (of being) the first source of false information shared about our
                    candidate ...".[156] Two days before the French presidential election on 7 May,
                    it was reported that nine gigabytes of Macron's campaign emails had been
                    anonymously posted to Pastebin, a document-sharing site. These documents were
                    then spread onto the imageboard 4chan, which led to the hashtag "#macronleaks"
                    trending on Twitter.[157][158] In a statement the same evening, Macron's
                    political movement, En Marche, said: "The En Marche movement has been the victim
                    of a massive and coordinated hack this evening which has given rise to the
                    diffusion on social media of various internal information".[159] Macron's
                    campaign had previously been presented a report in March 2017 by the Japanese
                    cyber security firm Trend Micro detailing how En Marche had been the target of
                    phishing attacks.[160] Trend Micro said that the group conducting these attacks
                    was the Russian hacking group Fancy Bear, also accused of hacking the Democratic
                    National Committee on 22 July 2016.[160] 21,075 verified emails and another
                    50,773 emails it could not verify were released in July 2017 by WikiLeaks.[161]
                    This followed Le Pen accusing Macron of tax avoidance.[162] On 7 May 2017,
                    Macron was elected President of France with 66.1% of the vote to Marine Le Pen's
                    33.9%. The election had record abstention at 25.4%, and 8% of ballots were blank
                    or spoiled.[163] Macron resigned from his role as president of En Marche[164]
                    and Catherine Barbaroux became interim leader.[165] Macron qualified for the
                    runoff after the first round of the election on 23 April 2017. He won the second
                    round of the presidential election on 7 May 2017 by a landslide according to
                    preliminary results,[166] making the candidate of the National Front, Marine Le
                    Pen, concede.[167] At 39, he became the youngest president in French history and
                    the youngest French head of state since Napoleon.[168][169] He is also the first
                    president of France born after the establishment of the Fifth Republic in 1958.
                    Macron formally became president on 14 May.[170] He appointed Patrick Strzoda as
                    his chief of staff[171] and Ismaël Emelien as his special advisor for strategy,
                    communication and speeches.[172] On 15 May, he appointed Édouard Philippe of the
                    Republicans as Prime Minister.[173][174] On the same day, he made his first
                    official foreign visit, meeting in Berlin with Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of
                    Germany. The two leaders emphasised the importance of France–Germany relations
                    to the European Union.[175] They agreed to draw up a "common road map" for
                    Europe, insisting that neither was against changes to the Treaties of the
                    European Union.[176] In the 2017 legislative election, Macron's party La
                    République En Marche and its Democratic Movement allies secured a comfortable
                    majority, winning 350 seats out of 577.[177] After the Republicans emerged as
                    the winners of the Senate elections, government spokesman Christophe Castaner
                    stated the elections were a "failure" for his party.[178] On 3 July 2020, Macron
                    appointed the centre-right Jean Castex as the Prime Minister of France. Castex,
                    described as a social conservative, was a member of the Republicans.[179] The
                    appointment was described as "doubling down on a course that is widely seen as
                    centre-right in economic terms".[180] In his first few months as president,
                    Macron pressed for the enactment of a package of reforms on public ethics,
                    labour laws, taxes, and law enforcement agency powers.[citation needed] In
                    response to Penelopegate, the National Assembly passed a part of Macron's
                    proposed law to stop mass corruption in French politics by July 2017, banning
                    elected representatives from hiring family members.[181] Meanwhile, the second
                    part of the law scrapping a constituency fund was scheduled for voting after
                    Senate objections.[182] Macron's plan to give his wife an official role within
                    government came under fire with criticisms ranging from its being undemocratic
                    to what critics perceive as a contradiction to his fight against nepotism.[183]
                    Following an online petition of nearly 290,000 signatures on change.org Macron
                    abandoned the plan.[184] On 9 August, the National Assembly adopted the bill on
                    public ethics, a key theme of Macron's campaign, after debates on the scrapping
                    the constituency funds.[185] Macron aims to shift union-management relations
                    away from the adversarial lines of the current French system and toward a more
                    flexible, consensus-driven system modelled after Germany and
                    Scandinavia.[186][187] He has also pledged to act against companies employing
                    cheaper labour from eastern Europe and in return affecting jobs of French
                    workers, what he has termed as "social dumping". Under the Posted Workers
                    Directive 1996, eastern European workers can be employed for a limited time at
                    the salary level in eastern European countries, which has led to dispute between
                    the EU states.[188] The French government announced the proposed changes to
                    France's labour rules ("Code du Travail"), being among the first steps taken by
                    Macron and his government to galvanize the French economy.[189] Macron's reform
                    efforts have encountered resistance from some French trade unions.[190] The
                    largest trade union, the CFDT, has taken a conciliatory approach to Macron's
                    push and has engaged in negotiations with the president, while the more militant
                    CGT is more hostile to reforms.[186][187] Macron's labour minister, Muriel
                    Pénicaud, is overseeing the effort.[191] </groupText>

                <groupText>The National Assembly including the Senate approved the proposal,
                    allowing the government to loosen the labour laws after negotiations with unions
                    and employers' groups.[192] The reforms, which were discussed with unions, limit
                    payouts for dismissals deemed unfair and give companies greater freedom to hire
                    and fire employees as well as to define acceptable working conditions. The
                    president signed five decrees reforming the labour rules on 22 September.[193]
                    Government figures released in October 2017 revealed that during the legislative
                    push to reform the labour code, the unemployment rate had dropped 1.8%, the
                    biggest since 2001.[194] Speaking on refugees and, specifically, the Calais
                    Jungle, Macron said on 16 January 2018 that he would not allow another refugee
                    camp to form in Paris before outlining the government policy towards immigration
                    and asylum.[195] He has also announced plans to speed up asylum applications and
                    deportations but give refugees better housing.[196] On 23 June 2018, President
                    Macron said: "The reality is that Europe is not experiencing a migration crisis
                    of the same magnitude as the one it experienced in 2015", "a country like Italy
                    has not at all the same migratory pressure as last year. The crisis we are
                    experiencing today in Europe is a political crisis".[197] In November 2019,
                    Macron introduced new immigration rules to restrict the number of refugees
                    reaching France, while stating to "take back control" of the immigration
                    policy.[198] Pierre de Villiers, then-Chief of the General Staff of the Armies,
                    stepped down on 19 July 2017 following a confrontation with Macron.[199] De
                    Villiers cited the military budget cut of €850 million as the main reason he was
                    stepping down. Le Monde later reported that De Villiers told a parliamentary
                    group, "I will not let myself be fucked like this."[200] Macron named François
                    Lecointre as De Villiers' replacement.[201] Macron's government presented its
                    first budget on 27 September, the terms of which reduced taxes as well as
                    spending to bring the public deficit in line with the EU's fiscal rules.[202]
                    The budget replaced the wealth tax with one targeting real estate, fulfilling
                    Macron's campaign pledge to scrap the wealth tax.[203] Before it was replaced,
                    the tax collected up to 1.5% of the wealth of French residents whose global
                    worth exceeded €1.3m.[204] In February 2018, Macron announced a plan to offer
                    voluntary redundancy in an attempt to further cut jobs from the French civil
                    service.[205] In December 2019, Macron announced that he would scrap the
                    20th-century pension system and introduce a single national pension system
                    managed by the state.[206] In January 2020, after weeks of public transport
                    shutdown and vandalism across Paris against the new pension plan, Macron
                    compromised on the plan by revising the retirement age.[207] In February, the
                    pension overhaul was adopted by decree using Article 49 of the French
                    constitution.[208] However, on 16 March 2020, Macron announced that the draft
                    legislation would be pulled as France went into lockdown to slow the spread of
                    COVID-19.[209] In July 2017, the Senate approved its first reading of a
                    controversial bill with stricter anti-terror laws, a campaign pledge of Macron.
                    The National Assembly voted on 3 October to pass t bill 415–127, with 19
                    abstentions. Interior Minister Gérard Collomb described France as being "still
                    in a state of war" ahead of the vote, with the 1 October Marseille stabbing
                    having taken place two days prior. The Senate then passed the bill on its second
                    reading by a 244–22 margin on 18 October. Later that day Macron stated that 13
                    terror plots had been foiled since early 2017. The law replaced the state of
                    emergency in France and made some of its provisions permanent.[210] The bill was
                    criticized by human rights advocates. A public poll by Le Figaro showed 57% of
                    the respondents approved of it even though 62% thought it would encroach on
                    personal freedoms.[211] The law gives authorities expanded power to search
                    homes, restrict movement, close places of worship,[212] and search areas around
                    train stations and international ports and airports. It was passed after
                    modifications to address concerns about civil liberties. The most punitive
                    measures will be reviewed annually and were scheduled to lapse by the end of
                    2020.[213] The bill was signed into law by Macron on 30 October 2017. He
                    announced that starting 1 November, it would bring an end to the state of
                    emergency.[214] Visiting Corsica in February 2018, Macron sparked controversy
                    when he rejected Corsican nationalist wishes for Corsican as an official
                    language[215] but offered to recognize Corsica in the French constitution.[216]
                    Macron also proposed a plan to "reorganise" the Islamic religion in France
                    saying: "We are working on the structuring of Islam in France and also on how to
                    explain it, which is extremely important – my goal is to rediscover what lies at
                    the heart of laïcité, the possibility of being able to believe as not to
                    believe, in order to preserve national cohesion and the possibility of having
                    free consciousness." He declined to reveal further information about the
                    plan.[217] Macron attended the 2017 Brussels summit on 25 May 2017, his first
                    NATO summit as president of France. At the summit, he met US President Donald
                    Trump for the first time. The meeting was widely publicized due to a handshake
                    between the two of them, characterized as a "power-struggle".[218][219] On 29
                    May 2017, Macron met with Vladimir Putin at the Palace of Versailles. The
                    meeting sparked controversy when Macron denounced Russia Today and Sputnik,
                    accusing the news agencies of being "organs of influence and propaganda, of
                    lying propaganda".[220][221] Macron also urged cooperation in the conflict
                    against ISIS and warned that France would respond with force in Syria if
                    chemical weapons were used.[222] In response to the chemical attack in Douma,
                    Syria in 2018, Macron directed French participation in airstrikes against Syrian
                    government sites, coordinated with the United States and the United
                    Kingdom.[223][224] In his first major foreign policy speech on 29 August,
                    President Macron stated that fighting Islamist terrorism at home and abroad was
                    France's top priority. Macron urged a tough international stance to pressure
                    North Korea into negotiations, on the same day it fired a missile over Japan. He
                    also affirmed his support for the Iranian nuclear deal and criticized
                    Venezuela's government as a "dictatorship". He added that he would announce his
                    new initiatives on the future of the European Union after the German elections
                    in September.[225] At the 56th Munich Security Conference in February, Macron
                    presented his 10-year vision policy to strengthen the European Union. Macron
                    remarked that larger budget, integrated capital markets, effective defence
                    policy and quick decision-making held the key for Europe. He added that reliance
                    on NATO and especially the US and the UK was not good for Europe, and a dialogue
                    must be established with Russia.[226] Prior to the 45th G7 summit in Biarritz,
                    France, Macron hosted Vladimir Putin at the Fort de Brégançon, stating that
                    "Russia fully belongs within a Europe of values."[227] At the summit itself,
                    Macron was invited to attend on the margins by Iranian Foreign Minister Javad
                    Zarif.[clarification needed] Macron, who "attempted a high-risk diplomatic
                    gambit", thought that the Foreign Minister of Iran might be able to defuse the
                    tense situation over the Iranian nuclear programme in spite of the recent uptick
                    in tensions between the Islamic Republic and the United States and Britain.[228]
                    In March 2019, at a time when China–U.S. economic relations were troubled with a
                    trade war underway, Macron and Chinese leader Xi Jinping signed a series of 15
                    large-scale trade and business agreements totaling 40 billion euros (US$45
                    billion) which covered many sectors over a period of years.[229] This included a
                    €30 billion purchase of airplanes from Airbus. Going beyond aviation, the new
                    trade agreement covered French exports of chicken, a French-built offshore wind
                    farm in China, a Franco-Chinese cooperation fund, as well as billions of Euros
                    of co-financing between BNP Paribas and the Bank of China. Other plans included
                    billions of euros to be spent on modernizing Chinese factories, as well as new
                    ship building.[230] In July 2020, Macron called for sanctions against Turkey for
                    violating Greece's and Cyprus' sovereignty, saying it is "not acceptable that
                    the maritime space of (EU) member states be violated and threatened."[231] He
                    also criticized Turkish military intervention in Libya.[232][233] Macron said
                    that "We have the right to expect more from Turkey than from Russia, given that
                    it is a member of NATO."[234] In 2021, Macron was reported as saying Northern
                    Ireland was not truly part of the United Kingdom following disputes with UK
                    Prime Minister Boris Johnson over implementations of the Northern Ireland
                    protocol.[235] He later denied this, saying he was referring to the fact that
                    Great Britain is separated from Northern Ireland by sea in reference to the
                    Irish Sea border.[236][237] </groupText>

                <groupText>French-U.S. relations became tense in September 2021 due to fallout from
                    the AUKUS security pact between the United States, the United Kingdom, and
                    Australia. The security pact is directed at countering Chinese power in the
                    Indo-Pacific region. As part of the agreement, the U.S. agreed to provide
                    nuclear-powered submarines to Australia. After entering into AUKUS, the
                    Australian government canceled an agreement that it had made with France for the
                    provision of French conventionally powered submarines, angering the French
                    government.[238] On 17 September, France recalled its ambassadors from Australia
                    and the US for consultations.[239] Despite tension in the past, France had never
                    before withdrawn its ambassador to the United States.[240] After a call between
                    Macron and U.S. President Joe Biden on request from the latter, the two leaders
                    agreed to reduce bilateral tensions, and the White House acknowledged the crisis
                    could have been averted if there had been open consultations between
                    allies.[241][242][unreliable source?] On 26 November 2021, Macron and Italian
                    Prime Minister Mario Draghi signed the Quirinal Treaty at the Quirinal Palace in
                    Rome.[243] The treaty aimed to promote the convergence and coordination of
                    French and Italian positions in matters of European and foreign policies,
                    security and defence, migration policy, economy, education, research, culture
                    and cross-border cooperation.[244] During the prelude to the 2022 Russian
                    invasion of Ukraine, Macron spoke face-to-face and on the phone to Russian
                    President Vladimir Putin.[245] During Macron's campaign for the re-election,
                    nearly two months after the Russian invasion began, Macron called on European
                    leaders to maintain dialogue with Putin.[246] According to an IFOP poll for Le
                    Journal du Dimanche, Macron started his five-year term with a 62% approval
                    rating,[247][248] which rose to 64% by 24 June.[249] One month later, Macron
                    suffered a 10% point drop in popularity, the largest at the beginning of a term
                    for any president since Jacques Chirac in 1995, and by August, his popularity
                    had fallen off 24 percentage points since June.[250] This was attributed to his
                    recent confrontations with former Chief of Defence Staff Pierre de
                    Villiers,[251] the nationalization of the Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard
                    owned by the bankrupt STX Offshore &amp; Shipbuilding,[252] and a reduction in
                    housing benefits.[253] By the end of September 2017, seven out of ten
                    respondents said that they believed Emmanuel Macron was respecting his campaign
                    promises,[254][255] though a majority felt that the policies the government was
                    putting forward were "unfair".[256] Macron's popularity fell sharply again in
                    2018, reaching about 25% by the end of November during the yellow vests
                    movement.[257][unreliable source?] During the COVID-19 pandemic in France, his
                    popularity increased, reaching 50% at its highest in July 2020.[258][259] On 18
                    July 2018, Le Monde revealed in an article that a member of Macron's staff
                    Alexandre Benalla posed as a police officer and beat a protester during May Day
                    demonstrations in Paris earlier in the year and was suspended for a period of 15
                    days before only being internally demoted. The Élysée failed to refer the case
                    to the public prosecutor and a preliminary investigation into the case was not
                    opened until the day after the publication of the article, and the lenient
                    penalty served by Benalla raised questions within the opposition about whether
                    the executive deliberately chose not to inform the public prosecutor as required
                    under the code of criminal procedure.[260] In the 2022 election, Macron was the
                    first incumbent to be re-elected since Jacques Chirac defeated Jean-Marie Le Pen
                    in the 2002 election.[261] Macron again defeated Marine Le Pen in the runoff,
                    this time by a closer margin, with 58.55% of the votes to Le Pen's 41.45%.[262]
                    Due to near-record abstentions, this represented 38.52% of registered voters,
                    the lowest figure since Georges Pompidou's 37.5% in 1969.[263] The French
                    far-right received their highest vote total since the start of the French
                    Republic, with nationalist candidates (Le Pen, Zemmour and Dupont-Aignan)
                    winning 32.3% of the votes in the first round and Le Pen achieving a record
                    41.5% of the votes in the second round.[citation needed] Though Macron's second
                    inauguration took place on 7 May 2022, his second presidential term officially
                    began on 14 May 2022. On 16 May 2022, Prime Minister Jean Castex resigned after
                    22 months as head of government. The same day, President Macron appointed
                    Élisabeth Borne at the Hôtel Matignon, thus making her the second female PM in
                    French history after Édith Cresson between 1991 and 1992. She then formed a new
                    government on 20 May 2022. In June 2022, one month into his second term, less
                    than two weeks before the end of the French presidency of the Council of the EU
                    and days after he called for voters to hand him a "solid majority" in a
                    controversial 'tarmac speech',[264] Macron lost his parliamentary majority and
                    was returned a hung parliament in the second round of the 2022 legislative
                    election:[265] Macron's presidential coalition, which had a 115-seat majority
                    going into the election, failed to reach the threshold of 289 seats needed to
                    command an overall majority in the National Assembly, retaining only 251 out of
                    the 346 it had held in the previous Assembly, and falling 38 short of an
                    absolute majority.[266] Crucially, three close political allies to President
                    Macron were defeated in the elections: incumbent President of the National
                    Assembly Richard Ferrand, Macron's own LREM parliamentary party leader
                    Christophe Castaner and MoDem parliamentary group leader Patrick Mignola, thus
                    effectively "decapitating" Macron's parliamentary bloc leadership and further
                    weakening the President's political position in hung parliament territory.[267]
                    Three government ministers resigned after losing their seats: Justine Bénin
                    (junior minister for the Sea), Brigitte Bourguignon (Minister for Health and
                    Prevention) and Amélie de Montchalin (Minister for Ecological Transition).[268]
                    Macron's government, still led by Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne, was reshuffled
                    in early July 2022 and continued as a minority administration, after talks with
                    opposition leaders to form a stable majority government failed.[269] Macron's
                    second presidential term began with two significant political controversies.
                    Hours after the new Borne cabinet was announced, rape accusations against newly
                    appointed Minister for Solidarity Damien Abad were made public,[270] and on 28
                    May, the handling of the 2022 UEFA Champions League final chaos at the Stade de
                    France in Saint-Denis drew criticism at home and abroad.[271] Despite its
                    minority status in the legislature after the 2022 legislative election, Macron's
                    government passed bills to ease the cost-of-living crisis,[272] to repeal the
                    COVID-era "state of health emergency",[273] and to revive the French nuclear
                    energy sector.[274] However, government proposals were defeated several times in
                    the National Assembly[275] and by the end of 2022, the Borne cabinet had had to
                    use the provisions of Article 49.3 of the Constitution ten times in a row to
                    pass the 2023 Government Budget and Social Security Budget.[276] In March 2023,
                    Macron's government passed a law raising the retirement age from 62 to 64,
                    partly bypassing Parliament by again resorting to Article 49.3 to break the
                    parliamentary deadlock.[277] Nationwide protests that had begun when the bill
                    was introduced back in January increased in intensity after the reform was
                    passed without a solemn vote.[citation needed][clarification needed] On 20 March
                    2023, Macron's cabinet, headed by Prime minister Borne, survived a cross-party
                    motion of no-confidence by only nine votes, the slimmest margin for such a vote
                    since 1992.[278] On 12 June 2023, his government survived its 17th no-confidence
                    motion since the beginning of the 16th legislature; the motion, brought by the
                    left-wing NUPES coalition, fell 50 votes short of the 289 votes needed.[279] In
                    early summer 2023, French authorities faced riots following the killing of Nahel
                    M., aged 17, by a police officer during a traffic stop.[280][281] To calm
                    widespread unrest, comparable in intensity to the 2005 French riots[citation
                    needed], Macron's administration ramped up government response, with a total of
                    45,000 police officers deployed on the ground and a ministerial order advising
                    courts to apply harsher sentences and accelerated procedures:[282] this
                    crackdown resulted in over 1,300 arrests on the fourth night of unrest alone,
                    bringing the total number of arrests since the riots' beginning to over 2,000 as
                    of 1 July.[283] On 20 July 2023, Macron carried out a government reshuffle at
                    the end of the "hundred days of appeasement and action" he called for in April
                    2023 following the violent protests surrounding the passage of his pension
                    system reform. Pap Ndiaye and Marlène Schiappa were sacked as part of the
                    reshuffle.[284] On 1 August 2023, Macron signed into law a multi-year military
                    planning bill, which set the stage for a 40%-increase in military spending to a
                    total of €413 billion between 2024 and 2030, after it was passed by the French
                    parliament on 13 July 2023.[285][286] In February 2023, Macron's government
                    introduced an immigration and asylum bill aimed at removing deportation
                    safeguards, fast-tracking asylum application process and immigration litigation,
                    while also facilitating legalization of undocumented workers.[287] His
                    government later pulled the draft legislation amid fears of defeat in
                    Parliament, instead planning to hold talks with the centre-right LR party before
                    reintroducing the bill in the autumn.[288] In August 2023, in a lengthy
                    interview with weekly magazine Le Point, Macron said that France "must
                    significantly reduce immigration, starting with illegal immigration" because the
                    "current situation is not sustainable".[289] </groupText>

                <groupText>On 11 December 2023, the "flagship" immigration bill introduced by
                    Macron's government was unexpectedly defeated after the narrow passage of a
                    motion for preliminary dismissal in the National Assembly.[290] Political
                    commentators and news media described the vote as a "spectacular debacle",
                    eventually sparking a major political crisis for Macron's minority
                    administration.[291] In an effort to salvage the bill, Macron's government sent
                    the draft legislation to a joint parliamentary committee: it resulted in a deal
                    with the conservative-controlled Senate on a drastically hardened bill. On 19
                    December 2023, the French Parliament passed the piece of legislation thanks to
                    support from the conservative LR and far-right RN parliamentary groups and in
                    spite of a major rebellion from Macron's own coalition and ministers.[292]
                    Health Minister Aurélien Rousseau, whom Macron had appointed to the government
                    only 6 months earlier, resigned shortly after the vote.[293] On the 65th
                    anniversary of the French Constitution on 4 October 2023, Macron unveiled
                    avenues for constitutional reform: broadening the scope and relaxing rules for
                    referenda; enshrining the right to abortion and climate protection in the
                    Constitution; stepping up the level of territorial devolution; giving some form
                    of political autonomy to Corsica and New Caledonia.[294] On 4 March 2024, a
                    joint session of the French Parliament passed a Macron-sponsored constitutional
                    amendment to protect abortion as a 'guaranteed freedom' in the
                    Constitution.[295] It represented the first constitutional reform since 2008 and
                    the first since Macron took office in 2017. In January 2024, in the wake of the
                    government crisis produced by the passage of the 'controversial' immigration
                    bill, Macron requested Prime minister Élisabeth Borne to resign and subsequently
                    replaced her by Education minister Gabriel Attal, making him both the youngest
                    head of government in French history and the first openly gay man ever to hold
                    the job.[296] The new Attal cabinet was widely described as the most
                    right-leaning government since the start of the Macron Presidency: out of the 14
                    Cabinet ministers appointed on 11 January 2024 by Macron and Attal, 57% are
                    former members of the conservative UMP/LR party, while prominent left-leaning
                    ministers of the outgoing Borne government were sacked, moves described as
                    indicating a notable tilt to the right.[297][298] In February 2024, amid slowing
                    economic growth and disappointing unemployment figures, Macron's government
                    unveiled €10 billion in emergency spending cuts to hold to its 2024 deficit
                    goal.[299] A month later, Macron convened a 'crisis meeting' to discuss the
                    state of France's public finances amid reports showing that the government had
                    heavily missed its 2023 fiscal targets, with a bigger-than-forecasted deficit,
                    putting the country's credit rating at risk of downgrade.[300] On 16 June 2022,
                    Macron visited Ukraine alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italy's Prime
                    Minister Mario Draghi. He met with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and
                    expressed "European Unity" for Ukraine.[301][302] He said that the nations that
                    remained neutral in the Russo-Ukrainian War made a historic mistake and were
                    complicit in the new imperialism.[303] In September 2022, Macron criticized the
                    United States, Norway and other "friendly" natural gas supplier states for the
                    extremely high prices of their supplies,[304] saying in October 2022 that
                    Europeans are "paying four times more than the price you sell to your industry.
                    That is not exactly the meaning of friendship."[305] Macron and his wife
                    attended the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II in Westminster Abbey, London,
                    on 19 September 2022, and the coronation of King Charles III the following
                    year.[306][307] On 23 October 2022, Macron became the first foreign leader to
                    meet new Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, just a day after she and her
                    ministers were sworn into office.[308] During a summit to China with European
                    Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, which included a formal meeting with
                    Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and President
                    of China, Macron called for Europe to reduce its dependence on the United States
                    in general and to stay neutral and avoid being drawn into any possible
                    confrontation between the U.S. and China over Taiwan. Speaking after a three-day
                    state visit to China, Macron emphasised his theory of strategic autonomy,
                    suggesting that Europe could become a "third superpower". He argued that Europe
                    should focus on boosting its own defence industries and additionally reduce its
                    dependence on the United States dollar (USD).[309] in a follow-up speech in The
                    Hague to further outline his vision of strategic autonomy for Europe.[310] On 7
                    June 2023, a report by the pan-European think tank European Council on Foreign
                    Relations (ECFR) found that most Europeans agree with Macron's views on China
                    and the United States.[311] In February 2023, he welcomed Ethiopian Prime
                    Minister Abiy Ahmed in Paris to normalize relations between France and Ethiopia,
                    strained by the Tigray War between the Ethiopian government and Tigray
                    rebels.[312] On 31 May 2023 Macron visited the GLOBSEC forum in Bratislava,
                    where he again delivered a speech on European sovereignty.[313] During the
                    question and answer session that followed the Bratislava speech,[314] he said
                    that negotiating with Putin may have to take priority over any war crimes
                    tribunal which some others, including Zelensky, wish to see.[315] On 12 June
                    2023, Macron promised to deliver more ammunition, weapons and armed vehicles to
                    help Ukrainian forces with the ongoing counter-offensive to liberate
                    Russian-occupied southeastern Ukraine.[316] At the NATO Summit in Vilnius, he
                    promised to supply Ukraine with Scalp long-range cruise missiles to hit Russian
                    targets deep behind the front lines.[317] On 10 November 2023, he said that what
                    Russia is doing in Ukraine is "imperialism and colonialism" and it was the
                    "duty" of France and other countries to help Ukraine defend itself, but added
                    that maybe the time will come to hold fair peace negotiations and find a
                    solution with Russia.[318] In June 2023 Macron hosted a global climate finance
                    conference described by many as the new Bretton Woods Conference. The purpose is
                    to adjust the global economy to the contemporary threats of climate change and
                    hunger. One of the proposition is to offer to low income countries help instead
                    of credits so they can use their resource for stopping climate change and
                    poverty instead of debt payments. Macron supported the idea, but a climate
                    activist from Uganda remarked that the promises were meaningless if at the same
                    time Macron supported projects like the East African Crude Oil Pipeline, a major
                    threat to the climate and to the drinking water of 40 million people.[319] At
                    the summit Macron proposed an international taxation system and debt
                    restructuring but stressed it can have an effect only with international
                    cooperation.[320] In July 2023, Macron postponed his planned state visit to
                    Germany due to the ongoing Nahel M. riots.[321] In October 2023, Macron
                    condemned Hamas' actions during the Israel–Hamas war and expressed his support
                    to Israel and its right to self-defense.[322][323] He criticized Iran for its
                    support of Hamas.[324] On 24 October, Macron visited Israel to express
                    solidarity with the country. He said that the anti-ISIL coalition should also
                    fight against Hamas.[325] On 10 November 2023, he called for a ceasefire and
                    urged Israel to stop bombing Gaza and killing civilians.[326] In January 2024,
                    he accused Hamas of using Palestinian civilians as human shields and said Israel
                    had the right to defend itself.[327] In February 2024, during a meeting with
                    other European states, Macron generated controversy by suggesting sending ground
                    troops to Ukraine.[328] In March 2024, Macron defended the Comprehensive
                    Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between Canada and the EU, branding the
                    agreement as a "very good deal", after the French Senate voted against its
                    ratification.[329] In March 2024 Macron and the Brazilian president Luiz Inácio
                    Lula da Silva agreed about cooperation between Brazil and France on different
                    environmental issues, including the transmission of 1.1 billion dollars for
                    preserving the Amazon rainforest.[330] On 10 July 2022, The Guardian revealed
                    that Macron had assisted Uber in lobbying during his term as the Minister of
                    Economics and Industry,[331] leading to calls from opposition lawmakers for a
                    parliamentary inquiry.[332][333] In his own defence, Macron expressed that he
                    "did his job" and that he would "do it again tomorrow and the day after
                    tomorrow".[333] He stated, "I'm proud of it".[333] As president of France,
                    Macron also serves ex officio as one of the two co-princes of Andorra. His chief
                    of staff Patrick Strzoda serves as his representative in this capacity. Joan
                    Enric Vives i Sicília, appointed as the current Bishop of Urgell on 12 May 2003,
                    serves as Macron's co-prince. Macron swore the Constitution of Andorra through
                    Strzoda in an act that took place on 15 June 2017 in Casa de la Vall.[334]
                    During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Andorran government asked France for economic
                    aid, but Macron refused, arguing that the Bank of France could not offer loans
                    to another country without the approval of the European Central Bank.[335]

                <groupText>Macron is married to Brigitte Trogneux,[336] 24 years his senior,[337]
                    and his former La Providence high school teacher in Amiens.[338][339] They met
                    during a theatre workshop that she was giving when he was a 15-year-old student
                    and she was a 39-year-old teacher.[340][341] His parents initially attempted to
                    separate the couple by sending him away to Paris to finish the final year of his
                    schooling, as they felt his youth made this relationship inappropriate.[14][341]
                    The couple reunited after Macron graduated, and were married in 2007.[341] She
                    has three children from a previous marriage; he has no children of his
                    own.[342][unreliable source?] Trogneux's role in Macron's 2017 presidential
                    campaign has been considered pivotal, with close Macron allies stating that
                    Trogneux helped Macron to develop skills like public speaking.[343] His best man
                    was Henry Hermand (1924–2016), a businessman who loaned €550,000 to Macron for
                    the purchase of his first apartment in Paris when he was Inspector of Finances.
                    Hermand also let Macron use some of his offices on the Avenue des Champs Élysées
                    in Paris for his movement En Marche.[344][345] In the 2002 French presidential
                    election, Macron voted for souverainist Jean-Pierre Chevènement.[346] In 2007,
                    Macron voted for Ségolène Royal in the second round of the presidential
                    election.[347] During the Socialist Party primary in 2011, Macron voiced his
                    support for François Hollande.[348] Macron plays the piano,[349] and studied
                    piano for ten years in his youth.[15] He especially enjoys the work of Robert
                    Schumann and Franz Liszt.[350][351] Macron also skis,[352] plays tennis[353] and
                    enjoys boxing.[354] In addition to his native French, Macron speaks fluent
                    English.[355][356] In August 2017, a photojournalist was arrested and detained
                    by the police for six hours after he entered the private residence where Macron
                    was vacationing in Marseille.[357] Macron subsequently filed a complaint for
                    "harassment".[357] In September 2017, he dropped the complaint "as a gesture of
                    appeasement".[358] On 27 August 2017, Macron and his wife Brigitte adopted Nemo,
                    a black Labrador Retriever-Griffon dog who lives with them in the Élysée
                    Palace.[359] As a schoolboy, Macron decided to be baptized as a Catholic. In
                    June 2018, prior to meeting Pope Francis, he identified himself as an agnostic
                    Catholic.[360][361] In the same year he agreed to become an honorary canon of St
                    John Lateran, the cathedral of Rome.[361] A fan of football, Macron is a
                    supporter of French club Olympique de Marseille.[362] During the 2018 World Cup,
                    he attended the semi-final between France and Belgium with the Belgian King
                    Philippe and Queen Mathilde,[363] and at the World Cup final against Croatia, he
                    sat and celebrated alongside Croatian president Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović. Macron
                    received widespread media attention for his celebrations and his interactions
                    with the Croatian president.[364][365][366][367][368] On 17 December 2020,
                    Macron tested positive for COVID-19[369] leading to the cancellation of his
                    scheduled trips for the following month, including a visit to Lebanon.[370]

            <modelAnswer>Yes, the given RDF statement can be inferred from the snippet.Reasoning:The
                snippet mentions that "On 23 April 2017, Macron received the most votes in the first
                round of the presidential election." This implies that Macron was a candidate in the
                presidential election. Additionally, it is mentioned that Macron "won the second
                round of the presidential election on 7 May 2017" and "was elected President of
                France with 66.1% of the vote." These statements confirm that Macron was successful
                in the presidential election.Given that the Charlemagne Prize is awarded for work
                done in the service of European unification, the inference can be made that Macron,
                as the President of France, would have been a potential candidate for such an award
                due to his role in governance and leadership within the European

                        Robertson, was English, and was born in Bristol, United Kingdom.[5][6] His
                        maternal grandparents, Jean and Germaine Noguès (née Arribet), are from the
                        Pyrenean town of Bagnères-de-Bigorre, Gascony.[7] He commonly visited
                        Bagnères-de-Bigorre to visit his grandmother Germaine, whom he called
                        "Manette".[8] Macron associates his enjoyment of reading[9] and his leftward
                        political leanings to Germaine, who, after coming from a modest upbringing
                        of a stationmaster father and a housekeeping mother, became a teacher then a
                        principal, and died in 2013.[10]</paragraphText>

                        garnered media coverage and faced reprimands from President Hollande,
                        raising questions about Macron's loyalty to the government.- The snippet

                                        Party). The text describes Macron as being different from

                                        is not associated with a particular political party's
                                        ideology, hence supporting the assertion that he is an

                                        Therefore, the inference that he is an "independent

                                        traditional party system and instead focus on the
                                        progressive and conservative divide. While this snippet

                        movement, En Marche, growing in the media.- It also talks about major
                        newspapers running front-page stories about Macron and En Marche.- These
                        details align with the RDF statement that Emmanuel Macron is a "member of
                        political party" and the political party he is associated with is
                        "independent politician".- Therefore, based on the information provided in
                        the snippet, we can infer that Emmanuel Macron is an independent politician
                        and a member of a political party (En Marche).</modelAnswer>

                                        ringardisé (become outdated or old-fashioned) not only the
                                        old software of political parties but also hollandisme (the
                                        politics of former French President François Hollande). This
                                        implies that Macron is not aligning himself with any
                                        traditional political parties or movements. Furthermore, the
                                        snippet describes Macron as a figure who is shaking up the
                                        left and the French political landscape in general,
                                        indicating his independent and non-partisan stance. Based on
                                        this information, it can be inferred that Emmanuel Macron is
                                        indeed an "independent politician" without any explicit
                                        mention of him being a member of a political party. </modelAnswer>

                                        mentioned that Emmanuel Macron was on the cover of the

                                        dynamics, and advocating for reinventing the country. It is

                                        not contain any information about Emmanuel Macron's
                                        political party affiliation. It only provides details about

                                        suit. There is no mention of him being an independent
                                        politician or a member of any specific political party. </modelAnswer>

                        back the symbol of Joan of Arc from the far-right.[101] Macron later went to
                        Puy du Fou and declared he was "not a socialist" in a speech amid rumours he

                        the 2017 presidential election,[103][104] to devote himself to his En Marche
                        movement.[105][106] There had been rising tensions and several reports that
                        he had wanted to leave the Valls government since early 2015.[107] He
                        initially planned to leave after the cancellation[clarification needed] of
                        his "Macron 2" law[83] but decided to stay on temporarily after a meeting
                        with President François Hollande.[108] Michel Sapin was announced as
                        Macron's replacement,[109] while Hollande said he felt Macron had
                        "methodically betrayed" him.[110] An IFOP poll showed that 84% of those
                        surveyed agreed with his decision to resign.[111]</paragraphText>

                        position of economy minister, media sources began to identify patterns in
                        his fundraising indicating he would run.[113] In October 2016, Macron
                        criticized Hollande's goal of being a "normal" president, saying that France
                        needed a more "Jupiterian presidency".[114]</paragraphText>

                        the French presidency after months of speculation. In his announcement
                        speech, he called for a "democratic revolution" and promised to "unblock
                        France".[115] He had expressed hope that Hollande would run several months
                        earlier, saying that—as the sitting president—he was the legitimate
                        Socialist party candidate.[116][117] Macron's book Révolution was published
                        on 24 November 2016 and reached fifth position on the French best-seller
                        list in December 2016.[118]</paragraphText>

                                        presidential candidate’s hometown. With its soaring
                                        13th-century cathedral, and charmless rebuilt central drag,
                                        Amiens is arresting both for its splendour and its banality.
                                        It is the place that shaped Mr Macron, and the town he fled.
                                        It was also the setting for a fraught encounter in the
                                        campaign’s closing days, which revealed much about the man
                                        who could soon be the next, and youngest-ever, president of

                                        he sat down with union leaders in a meeting room in the town
                                        centre, Ms Le Pen staged an ambush. Turning up unannounced
                                        at the Whirlpool factory gate on the outskirts, she claimed
                                        to be supporting “the workers” while Mr Macron was defending
                                        “the oligarchy”. His team hastily scheduled a campaign stop
                                        at the factory that afternoon. It was a brave decision. As
                                        plumes of black smoke rose from burning tyres, unionists in
                                        fluorescent jackets awaited his arrival in a hostile,
                                        muscular block. The acrid stink of charred rubber hung in
                                        the air. “We don’t expect anything of Macron, he’s just the
                                        continuation of Hollande,” declared Jean Santerre, a worker
                                        at the factory for 23 years. He said that he and his
                                        colleagues will vote for Ms Le Pen, because she will “shut
                                        the borders” and stop foreigners taking French
                                        jobs.</paragraphText>

                                        from his car, he was jeered. His security team trailed his

                                        picket line, just in case. Yet for nearly an hour the

                                        his erudite vocabulary and measured reasoning are mocked. At

                                        about a philosopher. Perhaps the only thing that his
                                        detractors and admirers agree on is that Mr Macron is “dans

                                        that Emmanuel Macron is married to Brigitte Trogneux, his
                                        former high school French teacher. - The provided RDF
                                        statement states that "Emmanuel Macron" has a relationship
                                        of "spouse" with "Brigitte Macron". - Although Brigitte
                                        Trogneux's last name is different in the snippet ("Trogneux"
                                        instead of "Macron"), it is a common practice for

                                        even after marriage. - Therefore, based on the information
                                        provided in the snippet, we can infer that the RDF statement
                                        ["Emmanuel Macron" - "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"] is indeed

                                        experience includes pushing through a number of unpopular
                                        business reforms, chief among them his signature Macron Law,
                                        which the government, due to its lack of support, had to
                                        force through by decree. The law aimed to boost economic
                                        growth by, among other things, allowing employers to more
                                        easily negotiate salaries and working hours, as well as

                                        from French tradition that Sundays should be a day of rest.
                                        Moreover, Macron’s independent candidacy runs against the

                                    <modelAnswer>Answer: No, the given RDF statement ["Emmanuel
                                        Macron" - "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"] cannot be inferred
                                        from the provided snippet. Reasoning: The snippet does not
                                        contain any information suggesting the relationship between
                                        Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Macron or any indication that
                                        Emmanuel Macron is married. It mainly discusses a political
                                        science student named Mathilde Sarda and her thoughts on
                                        hard work and inspiration from Emmanuel Macron's speeches.
                                        Therefore, there is no evidence in the snippet to infer the
                                        given RDF statement. </modelAnswer>

                                        confirms the relationship between Emmanuel Macron and

                                        Therefore, from the information provided in the snippet, we
                                        can infer that the RDF statement is correct. </modelAnswer>

                                    <modelAnswer>Yes, the RDF statement can be inferred from the
                                        given snippet. The snippet provides information that
                                        Emmanuel Macron married Brigitte Trogneux in 2007. It
                                        mentions that Brigitte Macron herself, in her confidences to
                                        Philippe Besson, indicated that Emmanuel Macron married her.
                                        Additionally, it describes details of their wedding,
                                        including Emmanuel Macron thanking guests for being there,
                                        implying the presence of Brigitte Macron at the wedding.
                                        Therefore, based on this information, it can be inferred
                                        that the RDF statement ["Emmanuel Macron" - "spouse" -

                                        given snippet because there is no mention of Emmanuel Macron
                                        or Brigitte Macron in the snippet. The snippet only talks
                                        about various political leaders and their lack of children,
                                        but does not mention anything about Emmanuel Macron or his
                                        spouse. Reasoning: 1. The snippet provided does not contain
                                        any information about Emmanuel Macron or his spouse Brigitte
                                        Macron. 2. The snippet only discusses the childless status
                                        of various political leaders, but does not mention any
                                        information about their spouses or personal relationships.
                                        3. Therefore, we cannot infer the relationship status of
                                        Emmanuel Macron from the given snippet. </modelAnswer>
