Bioluminescence is the production and emission of light by living organisms. It is a form of chemiluminescence. Bioluminescence occurs widely in marine vertebrates and invertebrates, as well as in some fungi, microorganisms including some bioluminescent bacteria, and terrestrial arthropods such as fireflies. In some animals, the light is bacteriogenic, produced by symbiotic bacteria such as those from the genus Vibrio;[1] in others, it is autogenic, produced by the animals themselves.

In a general sense, the principal chemical reaction in bioluminescence involves a light-emitting molecule and an enzyme, generally called luciferin and luciferase, respectively. Because these are generic names, luciferins and luciferases are often distinguished by the species or group, e.g. firefly luciferin. In all characterized cases, the enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of the luciferin.

In some species, the luciferase requires other cofactors, such as calcium or magnesium ions, and sometimes also the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In evolution, luciferins vary little: one in particular, coelenterazine, is found in 11 different animal phyla, though in some of these, the animals obtain it through their diet. Conversely, luciferases vary widely between different species, which is evidence that bioluminescence has arisen over 40 times in evolutionary history.

Both Aristotle and Pliny the Elder mentioned that damp wood sometimes gives off a glow. Many centuries later Robert Boyle showed that oxygen was involved in the process, in both wood and glowworms. It was not until the late nineteenth century that bioluminescence was properly investigated. The phenomenon is widely distributed among animal groups, especially in marine environments. On land it occurs in fungi, bacteria and some groups of invertebrates, including insects.

The uses of bioluminescence by animals include counterillumination camouflage, mimicry of other animals, for example to lure prey, and signaling to other individuals of the same species, such as to attract mates. In the laboratory, luciferase-based systems are used in genetic engineering and biomedical research. Researchers are also investigating the possibility of using bioluminescent systems for street and decorative lighting, and a bioluminescent plant has been created.[2]

Before the development of the safety lamp for use in coal mines, dried fish skins were used in Britain and Europe as a weak source of light.[3] This experimental form of illumination avoided the necessity of using candles which risked sparking explosions of firedamp.[4] Another safe source of illumination in mines was bottles containing fireflies.[5] In 1920, the American zoologist E. Newton Harvey published a monograph, The Nature of Animal Light, summarizing early work on bioluminescence. Harvey notes that Aristotle mentions light produced by dead fish and flesh, and that both Aristotle and Pliny the Elder (in his Natural History) mention light from damp wood. He records that Robert Boyle experimented on these light sources, and showed that both they and the glowworm require air for light to be produced. Harvey notes that in 1753, J. Baker identified the flagellate Noctiluca "as a luminous animal" "just visible to the naked eye",[6] and in 1854 Johann Florian Heller (1813–1871) identified strands (hyphae) of fungi as the source of light in dead wood.[7]

Tuckey, in his posthumous 1818 Narrative of the Expedition to the Zaire, described catching the animals responsible for luminescence. He mentions pellucids, crustaceans (to which he ascribes the milky whiteness of the water), and cancers (shrimps and crabs). Under the microscope he described the "luminous property" to be in the brain, resembling "a most brilliant amethyst about the size of a large pin's head".[8]

Charles Darwin noticed bioluminescence in the sea, describing it in his Journal:

While sailing in these latitudes on one very dark night, the sea presented a wonderful and most beautiful spectacle. There was a fresh breeze, and every part of the surface, which during the day is seen as foam, now glowed with a pale light. The vessel drove before her bows two billows of liquid phosphorus, and in her wake she was followed by a milky train. As far as the eye reached, the crest of every wave was bright, and the sky above the horizon, from the reflected glare of these livid flames, was not so utterly obscure, as over the rest of the heavens.[9]
Darwin also observed a luminous "jelly-fish of the genus Dianaea",[9] noting that: "When the waves scintillate with bright green sparks, I believe it is generally owing to minute crustacea. But there can be no doubt that very many other pelagic animals, when alive, are phosphorescent."[9] He guessed that "a disturbed electrical condition of the atmosphere"[9] was probably responsible. Daniel Pauly comments that Darwin "was lucky with most of his guesses, but not here",[10] noting that biochemistry was too little known, and that the complex evolution of the marine animals involved "would have been too much for comfort".[10]

Bioluminescence attracted the attention of the United States Navy in the Cold War, since submarines in some waters can create a bright enough wake to be detected; a German submarine was sunk in the First World War, having been detected in this way. The navy was interested in predicting when such detection would be possible, and hence guiding their own submarines to avoid detection.[12]

Among the anecdotes of navigation by bioluminescence is one recounted by the Apollo 13 astronaut Jim Lovell, who as a navy pilot had found his way back to his aircraft carrier USS Shangri-La when his navigation systems failed. Turning off his cabin lights, he saw the glowing wake of the ship, and was able to fly to it and land safely.[13]

The French pharmacologist Raphaël Dubois carried out work on bioluminescence in the late nineteenth century. He studied click beetles (Pyrophorus) and the marine bivalve mollusc Pholas dactylus. He refuted the old idea that bioluminescence came from phosphorus,[14][a] and demonstrated that the process was related to the oxidation of a specific compound, which he named luciferin, by an enzyme.[16] He sent Harvey siphons from the mollusc preserved in sugar. Harvey had become interested in bioluminescence as a result of visiting the South Pacific and Japan and observing phosphorescent organisms there. He studied the phenomenon for many years. His research aimed to demonstrate that luciferin, and the enzymes that act on it to produce light, were interchangeable between species, showing that all bioluminescent organisms had a common ancestor. However, he found this hypothesis to be false, with different organisms having major differences in the composition of their light-producing proteins. He spent the next 30 years purifying and studying the components, but it fell to the young Japanese chemist Osamu Shimomura to be the first to obtain crystalline luciferin. He used the sea firefly Vargula hilgendorfii, but it was another ten years before he discovered the chemical's structure and published his 1957 paper Crystalline Cypridina Luciferin.[17] Shimomura, Martin Chalfie, and Roger Y. Tsien won the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their 1961 discovery and development of green fluorescent protein as a tool for biological research.[18]

Harvey wrote a detailed historical account on all forms of luminescence in 1957.[19] An updated book on bioluminescence covering also the twentieth and early twenty-first century was published recently.[20][21]

In 1932 E. N. Harvey was among the first to propose how bioluminescence could have evolved.[22] In this early paper, he suggested that proto-bioluminescence could have arisen from respiratory chain proteins that hold fluorescent groups. This hypothesis has since been disproven, but it did lead to considerable interest in the origins of the phenomenon. Today, the two prevailing hypotheses (both concerning marine bioluminescence) are those put forth by Howard Seliger in 1993 and Rees et al. in 1998.[23][24]

Seliger's theory identifies luciferase enzymes as the catalyst for the evolution of bioluminescent systems. It suggests that the original purpose of luciferases was as mixed-function oxygenases. As the early ancestors of many species moved into deeper and darker waters natural selection favored the development of increased eye sensitivity and enhanced visual signals.[25] If selection were to favor a mutation in the oxygenase enzyme required for the breakdown of pigment molecules (molecules often associated with spots used to attract a mate or distract a predator) it could have eventually resulted in external luminescence in tissues.[23]

Rees et al. use evidence gathered from the marine luciferin coelenterazine to suggest that selection acting on luciferins may have arisen from pressures to protect oceanic organisms from potentially deleterious reactive oxygen species (e.g. H2O2 and O2− ). The functional shift from antioxidation to bioluminescence probably occurred when the strength of selection for antioxidation defense decreased as early species moved further down the water column. At greater depths exposure to ROS is significantly lower, as is the endogenous production of ROS through metabolism.[24]

</groupText></group><group><groupNumber>2</groupNumber><characters>9489</characters><groupText>While popular at first, Seliger's theory has been challenged, particularly on the biochemical and genetic evidence that Rees examines. What remains clear, however, is that bioluminescence has evolved independently at least 40 times.[26] Bioluminescence in fish began at least by the Cretaceous period. About 1,500 fish species are known to be bioluminescent; the capability evolved independently at least 27 times. Of these, 17 involved the taking up of bioluminous bacteria from the surrounding water while in the others, the intrinsic light evolved through chemical synthesis. These fish have become surprisingly diverse in the deep ocean and control their light with the help of their nervous system, using it not just to lure prey or hide from predators, but also for communication.[27][28]

All bioluminescent organisms have in common that the reaction of a "luciferin" and oxygen is catalyzed by a luciferase to produce light.[29] McElroy and Seliger proposed in 1962 that the bioluminescent reaction evolved to detoxify oxygen, in parallel with photosynthesis.[30]

Thuesen, Davis et al. showed in 2016 that bioluminescence has evolved independently 27 times within 14 fish clades across ray-finned fishes.[27] The oldest of these appears to be Stomiiformes and Myctophidae.[31] In sharks, bioluminescence has evolved only once.[32]

Bioluminescence is a form of chemiluminescence where light energy is released by a chemical reaction. This reaction involves a light-emitting pigment, the luciferin, and a luciferase, the enzyme component.[33] Because of the diversity of luciferin/luciferase combinations, there are very few commonalities in the chemical mechanism. From currently studied systems, the only unifying mechanism is the role of molecular oxygen; often there is a concurrent release of carbon dioxide (CO2). For example, the firefly luciferin/luciferase reaction requires magnesium and ATP and produces CO2, adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophosphate (PP) as waste products. Other cofactors may be required, such as calcium (Ca2+) for the photoprotein aequorin, or magnesium (Mg2+) ions and ATP for the firefly luciferase.[34] Generically, this reaction can be described as:

Instead of a luciferase, the jellyfish Aequorea victoria makes use of another type of protein called a photoprotein, in this case specifically aequorin.[35] When calcium ions are added, rapid catalysis creates a brief flash quite unlike the prolonged glow produced by luciferase. In a second, much slower step, luciferin is regenerated from the oxidized (oxyluciferin) form, allowing it to recombine with aequorin, in preparation for a subsequent flash. Photoproteins are thus enzymes, but with unusual reaction kinetics.[36] Furthermore, some of the blue light released by aequorin in contact with calcium ions is absorbed by a green fluorescent protein, which in turn releases green light in a process called resonant energy transfer.[37]

Overall, bioluminescence has arisen over 40 times in evolutionary history.[33] In evolution, luciferins tend to vary little: one in particular, coelenterazine, is the light emitting pigment for nine phyla (groups of very different organisms), including polycystine radiolaria, Cercozoa (Phaeodaria), protozoa, comb jellies, cnidaria including jellyfish and corals, crustaceans, molluscs, arrow worms and vertebrates (ray-finned fish). Not all these organisms synthesise coelenterazine: some of them obtain it through their diet.[33] Conversely, luciferase enzymes vary widely and tend to be different in each species.[33]

Bioluminescence occurs widely among animals, especially in the open sea, including fish, jellyfish, comb jellies, crustaceans, and cephalopod molluscs; in some fungi and bacteria; and in various terrestrial invertebrates including insects. In marine coastal habitats, about 2.5% of organisms are estimated to be bioluminescent, whereas in pelagic habitats in the eastern Pacific, about 76% of the main taxa of deep-sea animals have been found to be capable of producing light.[38] More than 700 animal genera have been recorded with light-producing species.[39] Most marine light-emission is in the blue and green light spectrum. However, some loose-jawed fish emit red and infrared light, and the genus Tomopteris emits yellow light.[33][40]

The most frequently encountered bioluminescent organisms may be the dinoflagellates in the surface layers of the sea, which are responsible for the sparkling luminescence sometimes seen at night in disturbed water. At least 18 genera exhibit luminosity.[33]  Luminescent dinoflagellate ecosystems are present in warm water lagoons and bays with narrow openings to the ocean.[41] A different effect is the thousands of square miles of the ocean which shine with the light produced by bioluminescent bacteria, known as mareel or the milky seas effect.[42]

Bioluminescence is abundant in the pelagic zone, with the most concentration at depths devoid of light and surface waters at night. These organisms participate in diurnal vertical migration from the dark depths to the surface at night, dispersing the population of bioluminescent organisms across the pelagic water column. The dispersal of bioluminescence across different depths in the pelagic zone has been attributed to the selection pressures imposed by predation and the lack of places to hide in the open sea. In depths where sunlight never penetrates, often below 200m, the significance of bioluminescent is evident in the retainment of functional eyes for organisms to detect bioluminescence.[43]

Organisms often produce bioluminescence themselves, rarely do they generate it from outside phenomena. However, there are occasions where bioluminescence is produced by bacterial symbionts that have a symbiotic relationship with the host organism. Although many luminous bacteria in the marine environment are free-living, a majority are found in symbiotic relationships that involve fish, squids, crustaceans etc. as hosts. Most luminous bacterial inhabit the marine sea, with Photobacterium and Vibrio genera dominating the marine environment.[44]

In the symbiotic relationship, bacterium benefit from having a source of nourishment and a refuge to grow. Hosts obtain these bacterial symbionts either from the environment, spawning, or the luminous bacterium is evolving with their host.[45] Coevolutionary interactions are suggested as host organisms’ anatomical adaptations have become specific to only certain luminous bacteria, to suffice ecological dependence of bioluminescence.[46]

Bioluminescence is widely studied amongst species located in the mesopelagic zone, but the benthic zone at mesopelagic depths has remained widely unknown. Benthic habitats at depths beyond the mesopelagic are also poorly understood due to the same constraints. Unlike the pelagic zone where the emission of light is undisturbed in the open sea, the occurrence of bioluminescence in the benthic zone is less common. It has been attributed to the blockage of emitted light by a number of sources such as the sea floor, and inorganic and organic structures. Visual signals and communication that is prevalent in the pelagic zone such as counter-illumination may not be functional or relevant in the benthic realm. Bioluminescence in bathyal benthic species still remains poorly studied due to difficulties of the collection of species at these depths.[47]

Bioluminescence has several functions in different taxa. Steven Haddock et al. (2010) list as more or less definite functions in marine organisms the following: defensive functions of startle, counterillumination (camouflage), misdirection (smoke screen), distractive body parts, burglar alarm (making predators easier for higher predators to see), and warning to deter settlers; offensive functions of lure, stun or confuse prey, illuminate prey, and mate attraction/recognition. It is much easier for researchers to detect that a species is able to produce light than to analyze the chemical mechanisms or to prove what function the light serves.[33] In some cases the function is unknown, as with species in three families of earthworm (Oligochaeta), such as Diplocardia longa, where the coelomic fluid produces light when the animal moves.[48] The following functions are reasonably well established in the named organisms.

In many animals of the deep sea, including several squid species, bacterial bioluminescence is used for camouflage by counterillumination, in which the animal matches the overhead environmental light as seen from below.[49] In these animals, photoreceptors control the illumination to match the brightness of the background.[49] These light organs are usually separate from the tissue containing the bioluminescent bacteria. However, in one species, Euprymna scolopes, the bacteria are an integral component of the animal's light organ.[50]

Bioluminescence is used in a variety of ways and for different purposes. The cirrate octopod Stauroteuthis syrtensis uses emits bioluminescence from its sucker like structures.[51] These structures are believed to have evolved from what are more commonly known as octopus suckers. They do not have the same function as the normal suckers because they no longer have any handling or grappling ability due its evolution of photophores. The placement of the photophores are within the animals oral reach, which leads researchers to suggest that it uses it bioluminescence to capture and lure prey.[52]

</groupText></group><group><groupNumber>3</groupNumber><characters>9686</characters><groupText>Fireflies use light to attract mates. Two systems are involved according to species; in one, females emit light from their abdomens to attract males; in the other, flying males emit signals to which the sometimes sedentary females respond.[48][53] Click beetles emit an orange light from the abdomen when flying and a green light from the thorax when they are disturbed or moving about on the ground. The former is probably a sexual attractant but the latter may be defensive.[48] Larvae of the click beetle Pyrophorus nyctophanus live in the surface layers of termite mounds in Brazil. They light up the mounds by emitting a bright greenish glow which attracts the flying insects on which they feed.[48]

In the marine environment, use of luminescence for mate attraction is chiefly known among ostracods, small shrimp-like crustaceans, especially in the family Cyprididae. Pheromones may be used for long-distance communication, with bioluminescence used at close range to enable mates to "home in".[33] A polychaete worm, the Bermuda fireworm creates a brief display, a few nights after the full moon, when the female lights up to attract males.[54]

The defense mechanisms for bioluminescent organisms can come in multiple forms; startling prey, counter-illumination, smoke screen or misdirection, distractive body parts, burglar alarm, sacrificial tag or warning coloration. The shrimp family Oplophoridae Dana use their bioluminescence as a way of startling the predator that is after them.[55] Acanthephyra purpurea, within the Oplophoridae family, uses its photophores to emit light, and can secrete a bioluminescent substance when in the presence of a predator. This secretory mechanism is common among prey fish.[55]

Many cephalopods, including at least 70 genera of squid, are bioluminescent.[33] Some squid and small crustaceans use bioluminescent chemical mixtures or bacterial slurries in the same way as many squid use ink. A cloud of luminescent material is expelled, distracting or repelling a potential predator, while the animal escapes to safety.[33] The deep sea squid Octopoteuthis deletron may autotomize portions of its arms which are luminous and continue to twitch and flash, thus distracting a predator while the animal flees.[33]

Dinoflagellates may use bioluminescence for defense against predators. They shine when they detect a predator, possibly making the predator itself more vulnerable by attracting the attention of predators from higher trophic levels.[33] Grazing copepods release any phytoplankton cells that flash, unharmed; if they were eaten they would make the copepods glow, attracting predators, so the phytoplankton's bioluminescence is defensive. The problem of shining stomach contents is solved (and the explanation corroborated) in predatory deep-sea fishes: their stomachs have a black lining able to keep the light from any bioluminescent fish prey which they have swallowed from attracting larger predators.[10]

The sea-firefly is a small crustacean living in sediment. At rest it emits a dull glow but when disturbed it darts away leaving a cloud of shimmering blue light to confuse the predator. During World War II it was gathered and dried for use by the Japanese army as a source of light during clandestine operations.[17]

The larvae of railroad worms (Phrixothrix) have paired photic organs on each body segment, able to glow with green light; these are thought to have a defensive purpose.[56] They also have organs on the head which produce red light; they are the only terrestrial organisms to emit light of this color.[57]

Aposematism is a widely used function of bioluminescence, providing a warning that the creature concerned is unpalatable. It is suggested that many firefly larvae glow to repel predators; some millipedes glow for the same purpose.[58] Some marine organisms are believed to emit light for a similar reason. These include scale worms, jellyfish and brittle stars but further research is needed to fully establish the function of the luminescence. Such a mechanism would be of particular advantage to soft-bodied cnidarians if they were able to deter predation in this way.[33] The limpet Latia neritoides is the only known freshwater gastropod that emits light. It produces greenish luminescent mucus which may have an anti-predator function.[59] The marine snail Hinea brasiliana uses flashes of light, probably to deter predators. The blue-green light is emitted through the translucent shell, which functions as an efficient diffuser of light.[60]

Communication in the form of quorum sensing plays a role in the regulation of luminescence in many species of bacteria. Small extracellularly secreted molecules stimulate the bacteria to turn on genes for light production when cell density, measured by concentration of the secreted molecules, is high.[33]

Pyrosomes are colonial tunicates and each zooid has a pair of luminescent organs on either side of the inlet siphon. When stimulated by light, these turn on and off, causing rhythmic flashing. No neural pathway runs between the zooids, but each responds to the light produced by other individuals, and even to light from other nearby colonies.[61] Communication by light emission between the zooids enables coordination of colony effort, for example in swimming where each zooid provides part of the propulsive force.[62]

Some bioluminous bacteria infect nematodes that parasitize Lepidoptera larvae. When these caterpillars die, their luminosity may attract predators to the dead insect thus assisting in the dispersal of both bacteria and nematodes.[48] A similar reason may account for the many species of fungi that emit light. Species in the genera Armillaria, Mycena, Omphalotus, Panellus, Pleurotus and others do this, emitting usually greenish light from the mycelium, cap and gills. This may attract night-flying insects and aid in spore dispersal, but other functions may also be involved.[48]

Quantula striata is the only known bioluminescent terrestrial mollusk. Pulses of light are emitted from a gland near the front of the foot and may have a communicative function, although the adaptive significance is not fully understood.[63]

Bioluminescence is used by a variety of animals to mimic other species. Many species of deep sea fish such as the anglerfish and dragonfish make use of aggressive mimicry to attract prey. They have an appendage on their heads called an esca that contains bioluminescent bacteria able to produce a long-lasting glow which the fish can control. The glowing esca is dangled or waved about to lure small animals to within striking distance of the fish.[33][64]

The cookiecutter shark uses bioluminescence to camouflage its underside by counter-illumination, but a small patch near its pectoral fins remains dark, appearing as a small fish to large predatory fish like tuna and mackerel swimming beneath it. When such fish approach the lure, they are bitten by the shark.[65][66]

Female Photuris fireflies sometimes mimic the light pattern of another firefly, Photinus, to attract its males as prey. In this way they obtain both food and the defensive chemicals named lucibufagins, which Photuris cannot synthesize.[67]

South American giant cockroaches of the genus Lucihormetica were believed to be the first known example of defensive mimicry, emitting light in imitation of bioluminescent, poisonous click beetles.[68] However, doubt has been cast on this assertion, and there is no conclusive evidence that the cockroaches are bioluminescent.[69][70]

While most marine bioluminescence is green to blue, some deep sea barbeled dragonfishes in the genera Aristostomias, Pachystomias and Malacosteus emit a red glow. This adaptation allows the fish to see red-pigmented prey, which are normally invisible to other organisms in the deep ocean environment where red light has been filtered out by the water column.[71] These fish are able to utilize the longer wavelength to act as a spotlight for its prey that only they can see.[71] The fish may also use this light to communicate with each other to find potential mates.[72] The ability of the fish to see this light is explained by the presence of specialized rhodopsin pigment.[71] The mechanism of light creation is through a suborbital photophore that utilizes gland cells which produce exergonic chemical reactions that produce light with a longer, red wavelength.[73] The dragonfish species which produce the red light also produce blue light in photophore on the dorsal area.[73] The main function of this is to alert the fish to the presence of its prey.[74] The additional pigment is thought to be assimilated from chlorophyll derivatives found in the copepods which form part of its diet.[74]

The angler siphonophore (Erenna) utilizes red bioluminescence in appendages to lure fish.[73]

Bioluminescent organisms are a target for many areas of research. Luciferase systems are widely used in genetic engineering as reporter genes, each producing a different color by fluorescence,[75][76] and for biomedical research using bioluminescence imaging.[77][78][79] For example, the firefly luciferase gene was used as early as 1986 for research using transgenic tobacco plants.[80] Vibrio bacteria symbiose with marine invertebrates such as the Hawaiian bobtail squid (Euprymna scolopes), are key experimental models for bioluminescence.[81][82] Bioluminescent activated destruction is an experimental cancer treatment.[83]

In Vivo luminescence cell and animal imaging uses dyes and fluorescent proteins as chromophores. The characteristics of each chromophore determine which cell area(s) will be targeted and illuminated.[84]

Engineered bioluminescence could perhaps one day be used to reduce the need for street lighting, or for decorative purposes if it becomes possible to produce light that is both bright enough and can be sustained for long periods at a workable price.[12][85][86] The gene that makes the tails of fireflies glow has been added to mustard plants. The plants glow faintly for an hour when touched, but a sensitive camera is needed to see the glow.[87] University of Wisconsin–Madison is researching the use of genetically engineered bioluminescent E. coli bacteria, for use as bioluminescent bacteria in a light bulb.[88] In 2011, Philips launched a microbial system for ambience lighting in the home.[89][90] An iGEM team from Cambridge (England) has started to address the problem that luciferin is consumed in the light-producing reaction by developing a genetic biotechnology part that codes for a luciferin regenerating enzyme from the North American firefly.[91] In 2016, Glowee, a French company started selling bioluminescent lights for shop fronts and street signs,[92] for use between 1 and 7 in the morning when the law forbids use of electricity for this purpose.[93][94] They used the bioluminescent bacterium Aliivibrio fischeri, but the maximum lifetime of their product was three days.[92] In April 2020, plants were genetically engineered to glow more brightly using genes from the bioluminescent mushroom Neonothopanus nambi to convert caffeic acid into luciferin.[94][95]

ATP bioluminescence is the process in which ATP is used to generate luminescence in an organism, in conjunction with other compounds such as luciferin. It proves to be a very good biosensor to test for the presence of living microbes in water.[96][97] Different types of microbial populations are determined through different sets of ATP assays using other substrates and reagents. Renilla- and Gaussia-based cell viability assays use the substrate coelenterazine.[98]

The snippet thoroughly describes bioluminescence as the production and emission of light by living organisms through a chemical reaction involving a light-emitting molecule (luciferin) and an enzyme (luciferase). This biological phenomenon is a result of internal processes within organisms that generate light. The snippet details the biochemistry of bioluminescence, its evolutionary history, and its various uses by organisms, such as camouflage and communication.On the other hand, the snippet does not specifically mention or describe iridescence. However, based on the understanding of these terms, iridescence is a physical phenomenon where an object's surface appears to gradually change color as the angle of view or the angle of illumination changes. This is not a biochemical light production but is caused by the physical structures on the surface of an object that reflect light in a certain way.Since iridescence relies on the physical reflection and refraction of light from different angles and does not involve the biochemical generation of light, it is a distinct concept from bioluminescence, which is an internally generated chemiluminescence.Therefore, we can infer that the RDF statement ["Bioluminescence" - "different from" - "iridescence"] is accurate based on the understanding that the snippet provides a detailed description of bioluminescence and how it differs fundamentally from the physical phenomenon of iridescence, which is not based on the production of light by living organisms.

While it does mention light emission and a "process called resonant energy transfer," it does not explicitly contrast bioluminescence with biofluorescence.Bioluminescence is the production of light by a living organism as a result of a chemical reaction. Biofluorescence, on the other hand, is a process where a living organism absorbs light and then re-emits it at a different wavelength. The snippet does not explain or contrast biofluorescence with bioluminescence; it merely describes part of the process of bioluminescence in Aequorea victoria. Although the transfer of energy to the green fluorescent protein hints at a fluorescence process, it does not provide a clear distinction or comparison between the two phenomena of bioluminescence and biofluorescence to infer that they are different.

He refuted the old idea that bioluminescence came from phosphorus,[14][a] and demonstrated that the process was related to the oxidation of a specific compound, which he named luciferin, by an enzyme.[16] He sent Harvey siphons from the mollusc preserved in sugar. Harvey had become interested in bioluminescence as a result of visiting the South Pacific and Japan and observing phosphorescent organisms there. He studied the phenomenon for many years. His research aimed to demonstrate that luciferin, and the enzymes that act on it to produce light, were interchangeable between species, showing that all bioluminescent organisms had a common ancestor. However, he found this hypothesis to be false, with different organisms having major differences in the composition of their light-producing proteins. He spent the next 30 years purifying and studying the components, but it fell to the young Japanese chemist Osamu Shimomura to be the first to obtain crystalline luciferin. He used the sea firefly Vargula hilgendorfii, but it was another ten years before he discovered the chemical's structure and published his 1957 paper Crystalline Cypridina Luciferin.[17] Shimomura, Martin Chalfie, and Roger Y.

However, the snippet talks about the Perseid meteor shower, which is an astronomical event related to the Earth passing through debris from a comet, resulting in a display of meteors in the night sky. It does not mention bioluminescence or phosphorescence at all.

Bioluminescence is a biological phenomenon where living organisms produce light, while phosphorescence is a physical process where a substance emits light it has absorbed previously.

The snippet talks about the phenomenon of bioluminescence, where some animals produce light from within their bodies. However, it does not provide any information about phosphorescence or how it is different from bioluminescence.

Bioluminescence and phosphorescence are indeed different phenomena — bioluminescence is the production of light by living organisms as a result of a biochemical reaction, while phosphorescence is a type of photoluminescence related to the delayed emission of light by substances after they have been excited by radiation. However, none of this information is contained in the snippet provided, and therefore, the RDF statement "Bioluminescence" - "different from" - "phosphorescence" cannot be inferred from it.
</modelAnswer><doesTextSupportRDF>NO</doesTextSupportRDF></paragraph><paragraph><paragraphText>Phosphorus was thought to be the source of light in living creatures. Researchers now know that bioluminescence is accomplished through oxidation (the addition of oxygen) in an animal protein called luciferin. When a molecule of oxygen, either in a gaseous form or mixed in a liquid, and an enzyme known as luciferase combine with luciferin, the resulting new molecule is excited and gives off light. Unlike fuel combustion, there is no heat associated with luminescence.</paragraphText><modelAnswer>Yes, the RDF statement can be inferred from the given snippet.

Reasoning:
The snippet explains the biochemical process behind bioluminescence, which involves an animal protein called luciferin and the enzyme luciferase in the presence of oxygen to produce light without heat. It contrasts this with "fuel combustion", which is known to produce both light and heat, but what it implicitly suggests is that bioluminescence is a specific type of luminescence that is biochemically distinct. 

Phosphorescence, although not directly mentioned or described in the snippet, is also a type of luminescence, like bioluminescence; however, it fundamentally differs in its mechanism—where phosphorescence involves the delayed re-emission of light after absorption. Since the snippet points out the unique mechanism by which bioluminescence operates, without any reference to phosphorescence, it can be inferred that bioluminescence is indeed different from phosphorescence (and other forms of luminescence such as fluorescence), even though the distinctions between these processes are not explicitly discussed.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it is implicitly understood that bioluminescence is a distinct phenomenon within the category of luminescence, making it different from phosphorescence. Hence, we can infer the "different from" relationship between "Bioluminescence" and "phosphorescence" from the snippet.

Reasoning:
The snippet discusses bioluminescence in animals and mentions that these animals can create light typically at night, and that there may be a dependency on the animal's daily cycle or the amount of time the animal is exposed to darkness. However, the snippet does not provide any information about phosphorescence or explicitly compare bioluminescence to phosphorescence.

To infer that "bioluminescence" is different from "phosphorescence," we would need a description or a comparison indicating what phosphorescence is, how it operates, and how it differs from bioluminescence. Since none of this information is presented in the snippet, we cannot conclude that bioluminescence is different from phosphorescence based on the information provided.

The RDF statement is making a claim about the relationship between "Bioluminescence" and "phosphorescence," stating that they are different from one another. However, the snippet provided does not mention phosphorescence at all. It discusses fireflies and their ability to produce light through a process, which is an example of bioluminescence. It does not compare bioluminescence to phosphorescence or provide any information on phosphorescence.

To infer the RDF statement from a snippet, there must be information about both bioluminescence and phosphorescence and how they differ from each other. Since such information is absent from the snippet, the RDF statement cannot be inferred.

The snippet discusses a behavioral trait of some female fireflies where they mimic the flashing signals of other species to lure and prey upon male fireflies. This snippet is referring to bioluminescence because fireflies exhibit bioluminescence to communicate, especially for mating purposes.

However, the snippet does not provide any information about phosphorescence or make any comparison between bioluminescence and phosphorescence to establish that they are different. Bioluminescence is a biological process that allows living organisms to produce light, typically through a chemical reaction involving luciferin and luciferase. Phosphorescence, on the other hand, is a physical process where materials emit light after absorbing photons, but with a delay, as the energy from the absorbed light is released over time.

To infer that bioluminescence is different from phosphorescence, the snippet would need to include information about both processes and a comparison highlighting their differences. Since the snippet does not mention phosphorescence at all, the RDF statement cannot be inferred from it.

The snippet talks about various organisms, including bacteria and dinoflagellates like Noctiluca, that can produce light. This ability to produce light is generally referred to as bioluminescence, which occurs in living organisms.

The RDF statement is stating that "Bioluminescence" is different from "phosphorescence." Phosphorescence is a specific type of photoluminescence related to the delayed emission of light by a substance that has absorbed photons (often from visible light). It is not a biological process but a physical/chemical one, observed in some chemicals and materials.

Since the snippet does not mention phosphorescence at all, it provides no information regarding its relationship with bioluminescence. Therefore, we cannot infer from the snippet provided whether bioluminescence is different from phosphorescence. For this inference to be made, the snippet would need to provide a comparison between the two phenomena or describe the physical or chemical processes behind them.

The RDF statement claims that "Bioluminescence" is "different from" "phosphorescence." To infer this RDF statement from the text, we would need information in the snippet that explicitly distinguishes bioluminescence from phosphorescence by describing them as different processes or phenomena.

The snippet provided talks about Noctiluca, which is a bioluminescent organism that lights up in response to physical disturbances in the water. However, it does not mention phosphorescence, let alone make any comparison or distinction between bioluminescence and phosphorescence. It simply describes the observable phenomenon of Noctiluca emitting light and does not provide any details on the biochemical or physical mechanisms behind the light production.

Phosphorescence is a specific type of photoluminescence related to fluorescence, but it involves a delayed re-emission of light after the excitation source has been removed, with a longer afterglow. On the other hand, bioluminescence is a biological process where living organisms produce light through biochemical reactions, typically involving a substrate (like luciferin) and an enzyme (like luciferase).

Without additional information delineating these concepts, the claim that "Bioluminescence is different from phosphorescence" cannot be derived from the provided text snippet.

This RDF statement is indicating that "Bioluminescence" is different from "Phosphorescence," which refers to a distinction between two types of light emission.

Snippet: "Comb jellies are similar to other jellyfish in their translucent, gelatinous appearance, minus the stinging tentacles. Instead, eight rows of fringed plates, called combs, propel them through the water."

The provided snippet describes comb jellies and how they move through the water using fringed plates called combs.

The RDF statement provided is expressing a relationship that "Bioluminescence" is different from "phosphorescence." However, the snippet does not mention "phosphorescence" at all. It merely describes an instance of bioluminescence displayed by the sea walnut, which flashes a green light along its combs when disturbed.

The snippet does not provide information about the definition, mechanisms, or characteristics of bioluminescence or phosphorescence, nor does it draw distinctions between these two phenomena. As such, while the snippet indicates that the sea walnut's light is likely due to bioluminescence, it does not contain sufficient information to support the assertion that bioluminescence is different from phosphorescence.

For the RDF statement to be inferred, the snippet would need to contain information that clearly indicates the differences between bioluminescence and phosphorescence, such as mentioning that the light from bioluminescence is produced by a biological process (like a biochemical reaction), whereas phosphorescence is a type of photoluminescence related to the delayed emission of light by substances after they have been excited by radiation (which is not a biochemical reaction in living organisms).

The RDF statement is making a claim about the relationship between "Bioluminescence" and "Phosphorescence," specifically that they are different phenomena. However, the provided snippet does not mention or describe phosphorescence at all. It only discusses bioluminescence and its occurrence in aquatic life.

In order to infer the relation "different from" between "Bioluminescence" and "Phosphorescence," there would need to be a comparison or explicit mention of both properties and how they differ from each other in the text. Since that is not present in the snippet provided, the RDF statement cannot be inferred.

To clarify the difference: Bioluminescence is the production and emission of light by living organisms, while phosphorescence is a process in which energy absorbed by a substance is released slowly in the form of light. Despite these being two distinct concepts, the snippet does not provide any information that could be used to distinguish between the two. Without the mention of phosphorescence, no inference can be made about its relationship with bioluminescence from this snippet.

The snippet discusses the potential functions of bioluminescence in animals, such as protection from predators and disguising appearance. It does not provide any information about the nature or characteristics of bioluminescence itself, nor does it compare bioluminescence with phosphorescence.

To infer that bioluminescence is different from phosphorescence, we would need information that directly contrasts the two phenomena, such as their mechanisms of light emission, persistence of the glow, or the energy sources involved.

Reasoning:
The snippet provided talks about bioluminescence as a natural phenomenon that can be observed in various places, such as backyards, the Chesapeake Bay, and in the water by watching creatures that produce their own light. However, it does not provide any information about phosphorescence or compare the two phenomena.

La bioluminescence procède en fait d’un phénomène bien connu qui, de tout temps, a étonné nos ancêtres lorsqu’ils découvraient, la nuit tombée, les lucisoles ou autres «vers luisants » . Mais on oublie souvent que la découverte et la première étude scientifique du mécanisme de la production de lumière par les êtres vivants remonte à plus d’un siècle et revient à Raphaël Dubois, pharmacien, ex-interne des hôpitaux de Paris, médecin, docteur-ès-sciences, qui fit carrière comme professeur à la Faculté des sciences de Lyon et à la station de Biologie marine de Tamaris (Var). Raphaël Horace Dubois est né au Mans le 20 juin 18493 d’Alexandre Dubois, pharmacien, établi dans cette ville Rue basse4 et de Catherine Hortense Bassompierre5. Après avoir été élève du lycée de sa ville natale, dont il sort bachelier ès sciences à 14 ans, il entreprend des études de pharmacie et effectue son stage – dont la durée était alors de trois ans – d’abord à Paris (officine de M. Guillemette), puis chez son père. En 1868, contre l’avis paternel, il s’inscrit à la fois en médecine et en pharmacie à l’École préparatoire de Tours, tout en passant l’internat en pharmacie du lieu, dont il est lauréat en 1869, et en y exerçant les fonctions de préparateur en botanique et chimie. Il revient alors dans la capitale où il s’inscrit à l’École supérieure de pharmacie. Il y prépare également le concours d’internat en pharmacie des Hôpitaux de Paris où il est reçu 4e en 1870, en même temps que Charles Tanret, le futur chimiste des alcaloïdes, qu’il retrouve à l''hôtel-Dieu6. Assuré de son indépendance financière pendant cinq ans grâce à l’obtention de la médaille de bronze de l’internat, il va poursuivre ses études médicales qui le conduisent en 1876 au diplôme de docteur en médecine, parallèlement à celles de pharmacie couronnées par le diplôme de pharmacien de 1re classe le 9 septembre 1875 avec la mention «Bien satisfait » 7.</paragraphText><modelAnswer>The RDF statement cannot be directly inferred from the given snippet. The snippet provides some historical background on Raphaël Dubois, who studied bioluminescence and the production of light by living organisms. However, it does not define what bioluminescence is nor does it compare it to phosphorescence or explain how the two phenomena are different from each other.

Phosphorescence is another type of luminescence that occurs when energy absorbed by a substance is released gradually in the form of light over time. Although bioluminescence and phosphorescence both relate to the emission of light, the underlying mechanisms and the substances involved in producing the light are different.

Since the snippet does not discuss the characteristics or mechanisms of phosphorescence, nor does it mention any comparison between bioluminescence and phosphorescence, the RDF statement "Bioluminescence" - "different from" - "phosphorescence" cannot be inferred from the text provided.

It then speculates on a shift in function from antioxidation to bioluminescence as species moved into deeper, darker parts of the ocean where the threat from ROS was reduced. There is no mention or comparison of bioluminescence to phosphorescence in the excerpt.In order to infer that bioluminescence is different from phosphorescence, the snippet would have to provide a distinction between the two phenomena, such as descriptions of their differing mechanisms, durations, or triggering conditions. Bioluminescence is a biological emission of light by living organisms which is catalyzed by enzymes, while phosphorescence is a type of photoluminescence related to fluorescence but with a longer afterglow due to forbidden energy state transitions.

Reasoning: The snippet talks extensively about bioluminescence, describing various applications and investigation into genetically engineered organisms that exhibit this trait. It also discusses how the process works in the presence of ATP, luciferin, and in the context of different species and applications. However, the snippet does not mention phosphorescence at all, nor does it provide a clear contrast between bioluminescence and phosphorescence. Bioluminescence is a chemical process where light is produced by a chemical reaction within a living organism, as detailed in the snippet with examples like fireflies, glowing plants, and bioluminescent bacteria used in lighting. Phosphorescence, on the other hand, is a physical process where a material absorbs and re-emits light slowly after having been energized, an effect that can last after the energizing source is removed and typically observed in "glow-in-the-dark" materials.Since the snippet does not discuss phosphorescence nor compare it to bioluminescence, the specific RDF statement provided cannot be inferred.</modelAnswer><doesTextSupportRDF>NO</doesTextSupportRDF></task><task><subject>Bioluminescence</subject><predicate>different from</predicate><predicateURL>http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P1889</predicateURL><object>fluorescence</object><objectURL>http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q191807</objectURL><textGroupID>1</textGroupID><promptID>1</promptID><modelAnswer>Based on the provided snippet, the RDF statement ["Bioluminescence" - "different from" - "fluorescence"] cannot be directly inferred.

It specifically mentions that bioluminescence involves a chemical reaction where light energy is released, involving luciferin, oxygen, and the enzyme luciferase. Furthermore, the snippet also distinguishes between luciferases and photoproteins (as in the case of Aequorea victoria).Fluorescence, on the other hand, is not described in the snippet, but it is a different physical phenomenon. Fluorescence occurs when a substance absorbs light at one wavelength (or energy level) and then re-emits light at a longer wavelength (lower energy level). This process does not typically involve an enzymatic reaction and can happen in a broader range of substances, often at room temperature and without the need for oxygen.In the snippet, the description of the process involving the jellyfish Aequorea victoria introduces the concept of resonant energy transfer, where the blue light released by aequorin after reacting with calcium ions is absorbed by the green fluorescent protein, which then emits green light. While this process involves fluorescence (green fluorescent protein), the distinction between the light produced via the enzymatic reactions typical of bioluminescence and the light emitted by fluorescence is implicit.Therefore, it can be inferred that bioluminescence and fluorescence are different phenomena based on the differing mechanisms described in the snippet for bioluminescence and the commonly understood mechanism for fluorescence, which is not dependent on enzymatic reactions and can take place under a broader range of conditions.</modelAnswer><doesTextSupportRDF>YES</doesTextSupportRDF><detailedResearch><paragraph><paragraphText>While popular at first, Seliger's theory has been challenged, particularly on the biochemical and genetic evidence that Rees examines. What remains clear, however, is that bioluminescence has evolved independently at least 40 times.[26] Bioluminescence in fish began at least by the Cretaceous period. About 1,500 fish species are known to be bioluminescent; the capability evolved independently at least 27 times. Of these, 17 involved the taking up of bioluminous bacteria from the surrounding water while in the others, the intrinsic light evolved through chemical synthesis.

It only discusses the evolution of bioluminescence in certain fish clades and sharks, providing information about how many times and in which species bioluminescence has evolved.Because the snippet does not provide any information about fluorescence or a comparison between fluorescence and bioluminescence, it does not support the inference of the provided RDF statement on the difference between the two.</modelAnswer><doesTextSupportRDF>NO</doesTextSupportRDF></paragraph><paragraph><paragraphText>Bioluminescence is a form of chemiluminescence where light energy is released by a chemical reaction. This reaction involves a light-emitting pigment, the luciferin, and a luciferase, the enzyme component.[33] Because of the diversity of luciferin/luciferase combinations, there are very few commonalities in the chemical mechanism. From currently studied systems, the only unifying mechanism is the role of molecular oxygen; often there is a concurrent release of carbon dioxide (CO2). For example, the firefly luciferin/luciferase reaction requires magnesium and ATP and produces CO2, adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophosphate (PP) as waste products. Other cofactors may be required, such as calcium (Ca2+) for the photoprotein aequorin, or magnesium (Mg2+) ions and ATP for the firefly luciferase.[34] Generically, this reaction can be described as:</paragraphText><promptID>1</promptID><modelAnswer>No, the RDF statement ["Bioluminescence" - "different from" - "fluorescence"] cannot be directly inferred from the given snippet. The snippet does not mention fluorescence or compare bioluminescence to fluorescence. While the RDF statement is a valid differentiator between the two phenomena, as they are indeed different processes, the snippet only explains what bioluminescence is, without providing information about fluorescence or making a comparison between them.

Photoproteins are thus enzymes, but with unusual reaction kinetics.[36] Furthermore, some of the blue light released by aequorin in contact with calcium ions is absorbed by a green fluorescent protein, which in turn releases green light in a process called resonant energy transfer.[37]</paragraphText><promptID>1</promptID><modelAnswer>Inferred RDF Statement: ["Bioluminescence" - "different from" - "fluorescence"]The snippet does not explicitly mention the term "bioluminescence," but it does describe the process in the jellyfish Aequorea victoria, which is known for its bioluminescent properties. The snippet talks about aequorin, which, when combined with calcium ions, produces a brief flash of blue light. This is part of the bioluminescent reaction.The snippet then mentions that some of this blue light is absorbed by a green fluorescent protein, which emits green light through a process known as resonant energy transfer. This is a description of fluorescence, whereby the green fluorescent protein absorbs light of one wavelength (blue) and emits it at another (green).Reasoning: - Bioluminescence refers to the production of light by living organisms through a biochemical reaction, typically involving a substance like luciferin and an enzyme like luciferase (or, in the case of Aequorea victoria, aequorin).- Fluorescence involves the absorption of light at one wavelength and the emission of light at another wavelength, without the chemical reaction that is characteristic of bioluminescence.The difference between these two processes is implied in the snippet through the description of the biochemical reaction for bioluminescence and the physical process for fluorescence. Bioluminescence is described in the context of a chemical reaction producing light (with aequorin and calcium ions), and fluorescence is described as a subsequent event where some of the light produced from bioluminescence is absorbed and then re-emitted at a different wavelength by the green fluorescent protein.Conclusion: Yes, the RDF statement that "Bioluminescence" is "different from" "fluorescence" can be inferred from the snippet, as the snippet distinguishes between the biochemical light production of bioluminescence and the light emission process of fluorescence, even though the terms "bioluminescence" and "different from" are not used directly.

This reaction has been postulated5 to follow the scheme in (Fig. 1), in which an essential component H2O2 of aequorin is bound to the protein part in a form such as a peroxyacid or an α-hydroxyhydroperoxide which readily releases H2O2. Hypothesised roles for peroxide in aequorin (see recent review6) are consistent with this scheme.

It usually occurs when certain materials absorb light or other electromagnetic radiation and emit light almost instantaneously. Without information in the snippet about the nature or mechanism of fluorescence, or any direct comparison to bioluminescence, we cannot infer that bioluminescence is "different from" fluorescence based solely on the text provided.To accurately determine that bioluminescence is different from fluorescence, we would need a snippet that explicitly describes both phenomena and highlights how their mechanisms or properties differ. Since the snippet provided does not offer this information, we cannot confirm the RDF statement as true based on the available evidence.</modelAnswer><doesTextSupportRDF>NO</doesTextSupportRDF></paragraph><paragraph><paragraphText>In the symbiotic relationship, bacterium benefit from having a source of nourishment and a refuge to grow.

However, the provided snippet does not mention fluorescence at all, nor does it explicitly compare bioluminescence to fluorescence. The snippet focuses on the symbiotic relationships involving bioluminescence, the benefits to the bacteria and hosts involved, and the evolutionary aspects of those relationships.To determine that bioluminescence is different from fluorescence, information on the definitions and properties of both phenomena, and how they contrast with each other, would be required. Such information is not present in the snippet provided. Therefore, the RDF statement cannot be inferred from the snippet.</modelAnswer><doesTextSupportRDF>NO</doesTextSupportRDF></paragraph><paragraph><paragraphText>Bioluminescence is widely studied amongst species located in the mesopelagic zone, but the benthic zone at mesopelagic depths has remained widely unknown. Benthic habitats at depths beyond the mesopelagic are also poorly understood due to the same constraints. Unlike the pelagic zone where the emission of light is undisturbed in the open sea, the occurrence of bioluminescence in the benthic zone is less common. It has been attributed to the blockage of emitted light by a number of sources such as the sea floor, and inorganic and organic structures. Visual signals and communication that is prevalent in the pelagic zone such as counter-illumination may not be functional or relevant in the benthic realm. Bioluminescence in bathyal benthic species still remains poorly studied due to difficulties of the collection of species at these depths.[47]</paragraphText><promptID>1</promptID><modelAnswer>The given RDF statement cannot be inferred from the provided snippet.RDF: ["Bioluminescence" - "different from" - "fluorescence"]The RDF statement is making a comparative claim about bioluminescence being different from fluorescence. To infer this from the snippet, there would need to be information explaining the distinctions between bioluminescence and fluorescence, such as the mechanisms behind each phenomenon or their differing appearances or conditions.Snippet:The provided text discusses bioluminescence primarily in the context of its occurrence in different ocean zones (mesopelagic and benthic) and mentions the challenges in studying bioluminescence in the benthic zone due to certain environmental factors such as light blockage by the sea floor and other structures. It also touches on communication via light in the ocean, and the difficulties of studying bioluminescent species in bathyal benthic zones.Nowhere in the snippet is fluorescence mentioned or compared to bioluminescence. Without any information on fluorescence or a direct comparison to bioluminescence, the statement that 'bioluminescence is different from fluorescence' cannot be logically inferred from the snippet provided.In summary, the snippet does not contain any information that addresses the difference between bioluminescence and fluorescence; hence, the RDF statement cannot be inferred.</modelAnswer><doesTextSupportRDF>NO</doesTextSupportRDF></paragraph><paragraph><paragraphText>Bioluminescence has several functions in different taxa. Steven Haddock et al. (2010) list as more or less definite functions in marine organisms the following: defensive functions of startle, counterillumination (camouflage), misdirection (smoke screen), distractive body parts, burglar alarm (making predators easier for higher predators to see), and warning to deter settlers; offensive functions of lure, stun or confuse prey, illuminate prey, and mate attraction/recognition. It is much easier for researchers to detect that a species is able to produce light than to analyze the chemical mechanisms or to prove what function the light serves.[33] In some cases the function is unknown, as with species in three families of earthworm (Oligochaeta), such as Diplocardia longa, where the coelomic fluid produces light when the animal moves.[48] The following functions are reasonably well established in the named organisms.</paragraphText><promptID>1</promptID><modelAnswer>No, the RDF statement "Bioluminescence" - "different from" - "fluorescence" cannot be directly inferred from the given snippet.Reasoning:The snippet provided describes various functions and examples of bioluminescence in different taxa. It talks in detail about how bioluminescence is used by various marine organisms and even an example with earthworms. However, it does not make any reference to fluorescence or establish a distinction between bioluminescence and fluorescence. Fluorescence is a different biological phenomenon where light absorbed by an organism is re-emitted at a different wavelength, which is not mentioned or explained in the snippet.

Bioluminescence is a chemical process in which living organisms produce light through a chemical reaction, while fluorescence involves the absorption of light at one wavelength and re-emission at a different wavelength.

The cirrate octopod Stauroteuthis syrtensis uses emits bioluminescence from its sucker like structures.[51] These structures are believed to have evolved from what are more commonly known as octopus suckers. They do not have the same function as the normal suckers because they no longer have any handling or grappling ability due its evolution of photophores. The placement of the photophores are within the animals oral reach, which leads researchers to suggest that it uses it bioluminescence to capture and lure prey.[52]</paragraphText><promptID>1</promptID><modelAnswer>No, the given RDF statement ["Bioluminescence" - "different from" - "fluorescence"] cannot be inferred from the provided snippet. The snippet talks about the bioluminescence exhibited by a certain species of octopod, describing how they use bioluminescence and suggesting it may be used to lure prey. However, the snippet does not discuss the concept of fluorescence, nor does it make any comparison between bioluminescence and fluorescence.Bioluminescence and fluorescence are two different phenomena. Bioluminescence is the emission of light by a living organism as a result of a chemical reaction. Fluorescence, on the other hand, occurs when a substance absorbs light at one wavelength (or color) and then emits light at a different, typically longer, wavelength.

Instead, the snippet focuses on the applications and research surrounding bioluminescence, such as its possible use in street lighting, its genetic engineering in plants and bacteria, and specific cases like the Glowee company's product and the use of luciferin.Even though experienced readers might know that bioluminescence and fluorescence are indeed different phenomena (bioluminescence is the production of light by a living organism through a biochemical reaction, while fluorescence is the emission of light by a substance that has absorbed light or other electromagnetic radiation, usually via a physical or chemical mechanism rather than a biological one), this specific difference cannot be inferred from the snippet provided because it does not discuss fluorescence at all.Given the available information in the snippet, one should conclude that the RDF statement cannot be inferred.</modelAnswer><doesTextSupportRDF>NO</doesTextSupportRDF></task><task><subject>Bioluminescence</subject><predicate>subclass of</predicate><predicateURL>http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P279</predicateURL><object>cell metabolism</object><objectURL>http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q13416689</objectURL><textGroupID>1</textGroupID><promptID>1</promptID><modelAnswer>No, the given RDF statement ["Bioluminescence" - "subclass of" - "cell metabolism"] cannot be directly inferred from the provided snippet.Reasoning:The snippet describes bioluminescence as the production and emission of light by living organisms, which is a form of chemiluminescence. It involves a chemical reaction between a light-emitting molecule (luciferin) and an enzyme (luciferase), often with the need of cofactors and the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP). While this process is indeed a chemical reaction that occurs within cells and involves metabolism (which is the set of life-sustaining chemical transformations within the cells of organisms), the snippet does not explicitly state that bioluminescence is a "subclass" or a specific type of cell metabolism.To say that something is a "subclass of" in RDF or ontological terms implies a hierarchy where bioluminescence would be a specific instance or a narrower concept within the broader category of cell metabolism. The snippet does not provide any such hierarchical classification or explicit statement that characterizes bioluminescence as a type or subset of cell metabolism. It describes bioluminescence as a process that happens in living organisms and involves metabolic enzymes and molecules, but it doesn't specify that it is a subset of cell metabolism.In summary, while bioluminescence is a biologically-mediated chemical process that involves metabolic components, the snippet does not contain information to classify it strictly as a subclass of cell metabolism, which is a broader term encompassing all the chemical reactions and processes occurring within a cell.</modelAnswer><doesTextSupportRDF>NO</doesTextSupportRDF></task><task><subject>Bioluminescence</subject><predicate>subclass of</predicate><predicateURL>http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P279</predicateURL><object>cell metabolism</object><objectURL>http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q13416689</objectURL><textGroupID>2</textGroupID><promptID>1</promptID><modelAnswer>No, the given RDF statement ["Bioluminescence" - "subclass of" - "cell metabolism"] cannot be directly inferred from the given snippet.Reasoning: The snippet describes bioluminescence in several contexts, explaining that it is a form of chemiluminescence where the light energy is released by a chemical reaction involving luciferin and luciferase, and mentions that it involves the reaction of a "luciferin" and oxygen catalyzed by a luciferase to produce light. However, while bioluminescence is indeed related to chemical processes within the cell, the snippet does not explicitly state that bioluminescence is a subclass of cell metabolism. Instead, it treats bioluminescence as a specific biochemical phenomenon.To infer a subclass relationship, we would expect language indicating that bioluminescence is a type or kind of cell metabolism or fits categorically within the broader process of cell metabolism.

For example, the snippet talks about the use of bioluminescent properties in plants and bacteria for lighting purposes, and the engineering of enzymes to regenerate luciferin in the bioluminescent reactions.However, the snippet does not make a direct statement regarding bioluminescence being a subclass or a type of cell metabolism. While bioluminescence involves metabolic processes and biochemical reactions within cells - more specifically, it involves the enzymatic oxidation of a light-emitting molecule (luciferin) in the presence of an enzyme (luciferase) and typically uses ATP - the snippet doesn't explicitly establish that bioluminescence is a subset or a specific kind of cellular metabolism.
