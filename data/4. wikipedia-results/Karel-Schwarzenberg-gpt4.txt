Karel, 12th and 7th Prince of Schwarzenberg  (Czech pronunciation: [ˈʃvartsn̩bɛrk], 10 December 1937 – 12 November 2023) was a Czech politician, diplomat and statesman who served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic from 2007 to 2009 and then again between 2010 and 2013. Schwarzenberg was leader and co-founder of the TOP 09 party and its candidate for president of the Czech Republic in the 2013 election. He served as a member of the Chamber of Deputies (MP) from 2010 to 2021 and in the Senate from 2004 until 2010.

From July 1990 to July 1992 Schwarzenberg served as the chancellor (director of the presidential office) to Václav Havel, while he was president. He went on to be elected as Senator for the municipal district Prague 6 from 2004 to 2010 and to serve as Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic from 2007 to 2009 and again from 2010 to 2013, originally as a non-partisan minister nominated by the Green Party. In May 2010, he was elected as a Member of Parliament for the newly founded pro-European centre-right party TOP 09, gaining the largest number of preference votes. He was candidate for President of the Czech Republic in the 2013 presidential election, and qualified for the second round, finishing as runner-up, with 45.19% of the votes.[3][4] Schwarzenberg was noted for his pro-European views.[5]

Schwarzenberg was the head of the House of Schwarzenberg, a formerly leading family of the Habsburg empire, from 1979 until his death. He was related to Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg, a statesman of the Austrian Empire.[6] From 1948 to 1990, he lived in Austria, where he was known as Karl Schwarzenberg, and was involved in politics for the Austrian People's Party and became a noted critic of human-rights violations in the Eastern Bloc, chairing the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights. Following the fall of communism, he became a close adviser to Václav Havel and relocated to Prague.

Schwarzenberg was married to Countess Therese von Hardegg (Therese Gräfin zu Hardegg auf Glatz und im Machlande) and they had three children, all of whom live in Austria. 

The House of Schwarzenberg originates in Franconia, where the family still owns substantial property,[citation needed] but made Bohemia their primary seat in the 17th century, also maintaining residences in Vienna. The family had possessed fiefdoms in Bohemia as far back as the Middle Ages; it was one of the richest noble families of Bohemia and Austria-Hungary, and one of the largest land owners of Bohemia.

Karel Schwarzenberg was the eldest son of Prince Karel VI of Schwarzenberg of the junior line (Second Majorat of the House of Schwarzenberg), and Princess Antonie von Fürstenberg. He was the 1,322nd Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece of Austria.[7] He was first cousin of Princess Ira and Prince Egon von Fürstenberg and second cousin of Rainier III, Prince of Monaco.  By tradition, he held the style of Serene Highness (German: Durchlaucht).

Schwarzenberg was born in Prague[8] and his family spoke both German and Czech. He was known for his "slightly archaic and often earthy Czech."[3] Schwarzenberg and his parents had to leave the country after the Communist coup of 1948, and emigrated to Austria, with Swiss citizenship.  He studied law and forestry at the universities of Vienna, Munich and Graz but left studies prior to graduation.[9] He had two sisters, Marie Eleonore von Bredow (born 1936) and Dr. Anna Maria Freiin von Haxthausen (born 1946), and one brother, Dr. rer. oec. Friedrich Prinz zu Schwarzenberg (born 1940).

On 22 April 1967, in Seefeld, Schwarzenberg married Countess Therese zu Hardegg[10] (b. Vienna, 17 February 1940).  The marriage ended in divorce in 1988.  The couple married for a second time on 25 July 2008.[11][12] His wife spends most of her time in Vienna and does not speak Czech.[5]

After the fall of the communist regime, Schwarzenberg returned to Prague in 1990, although he still occasionally visited Austria, where part of his family lives. He held both Swiss and Czech citizenship.[14]

Schwarzenberg was the second Czech Patron of The English College in Prague, succeeding the founding Patron Vaclav Havel after the latter's death. He was joint patron with King Charles.[15]

Schwarzenberg's daughter (conventionally known as Lila Morgan-Schwarzenberg) co-directed and co-wrote a documentary about her father and their strained relationship ("Mein Vater der Fürst") which was released in 2022.[16]

In the 1960s, Schwarzenberg was active in the conservative Austrian People's Party and contributed to reforming the party before the 1966 legislative election. Voices inside the party considered him a possible candidate for the position of Foreign Minister of Austria, the position he would occupy in the Czech Republic decades later.[17]

Schwarzenberg soon became active in the resistance against the communist dictatorship in Czechoslovakia and became a prominent human-rights advocate, and a leading voice against the communist rule of his native country after the Prague Spring. From 1984 to 1991 he was chairman of the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights, and in 1986 he founded the Dokumentationszentrum zur Förderung der unabhängigen tschechoslowakischen Literatur in Scheinfeld, West Germany. In 1989, he accepted the European Human Rights Prize on behalf of the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights.

A long-time friend and close collaborator of Václav Havel, he served for two years as Havel's chancellor (from July 1990 to July 1992) during Havel's tenure as president.

Schwarzenberg was elected as a Senator in the Czech Senate from the 6th District of Prague on 13 November 2004, having been nominated by the Freedom Union – Democratic Union (US-DEU) and Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) parties, and served until 29 May 2010.[18]

While a senator, he was expelled from Cuba in May 2005 (together with German MP Arnold Vaatz), where he was due to meet dissidents opposed to the Cuban President Fidel Castro.[19]

Between 9 January 2007 and 9 May 2009, he was Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic in Mirek Topolánek's second coalition government. His nomination by the Green Party caused a small controversy when President Václav Klaus stated that he had strong links to Austria and so would not be able to defend national interests.[20][21]
On 8 July 2008, he and the American Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice signed an agreement on the United States's Missile shield program.[22]

According to public opinion polls, he was the most popular politician in the Czech Republic in 2009, and he also usually received the most preferential votes in elections.[23]

In the first half of 2009, Schwarzenberg was also the Council President (Responsible national minister) of the European Union. Also in 2009, he and coalition colleague Miroslav Kalousek formed a new Czech political party TOP 09, which they led to success in the general elections of 2010, gaining 16% of the vote and representation in the Czech Parliament.

Schwarzenberg left office as Foreign Minister on 8 May 2009. He became Foreign Minister once again on 13 July 2010; he held the post until 10 July 2013.

On 11–12 January 2013, Schwarzenberg successfully took part in the first round of Czech presidential elections, the first popular vote for presidency of the country. With 23.40% of the total vote, he finished second behind former prime minister Miloš Zeman (24.21%). In the second-round run-off between the two men, held on 25–26 January 2013, Schwarzenberg received 45.19% of the vote and thus lost to Zeman.

From 2010 to 2021, he was a member of the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic for TOP 09. In the 2013 - 2017 election period, he was the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic. In 2021, he announced that he would no longer defend his mandate in the upcoming elections due to his deteriorating health.[24]

Schwarzenberg continued to comment on public events, usually in the form of comments in the media, interviews or debates.[25] After Petr Pavel was elected president of the Czech Republic in 2023, he became one of his advisors for foreign policy and internal policy.[26]

Schwarzenberg was hospitalised in Prague in August 2023 with heart and kidney problems and was later flown to a clinic in Vienna. He died there on 12 November 2023, at the age of 85.[27]

In December 2010, Schwarzenberg, along with the foreign ministers of five other Central and Eastern European EU countries, called upon the European Commission to make "the approval, denial or belittling of communist crimes" an EU-wide criminal offence. Schwarzenberg said that the denial of the crimes of communism is analogous to denying the crimes of Nazism, which in many EU countries is a criminal offense, arguing that "there is a fundamental concern here that totalitarian systems be measured by the same standard."[28]

In January 2013, while running for President of the Czech Republic, Schwarzenberg stated, referring to the Beneš decrees, that "what we committed in 1945 would today be considered a grave violation of human rights and the Czechoslovak government, along with President Beneš, would have found themselves in The Hague," referring to the International Criminal Court.[29] The decrees led to the expulsion of many Germans and Hungarians from Czechoslovakia by the Czechoslovak government of Edvard Beneš.[30]

In 2008, Schwarzenberg expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the Gaza–Israel conflict.[31]

He was generally known as Karl zu Schwarzenberg in German and uses the Czech form of his first name, Karel, in Czech.

Karel Schwarzenberg was the 12th Prince of Schwarzenberg, through his adoption by Heinrich Schwarzenberg, the brother of Joseph Schwarzenberg, the 11th Prince and last male member of the major Schwarzenberg line (First Majorat). Although Heinrich died before his brother Joseph III (the 11th Prince), the adoption allowed Karel Schwarzenberg to succeed to the major Schwarzenberg line. Thus, in his person the minor line (Second Majorat), of which he was part by origin, has been united with the major line.

In the Czech Republic, using of noble predicates is prohibited by law No. 61/1918 Sb. In Austria, noble predicates have been illegal since 1918 (i.e. nearly 20 years before his birth). If Schwarzenberg had used his titles, his name and style would have been:

Schwarzenberg was also a regular attendant to the Trilateral Commission and the Bilderberg meetings.

Reasoning:
The snippet directly states that Karel Schwarzenberg is "the chairman of TOP 09," which implies that he is not only a member of the political party TOP 09 but also holds a leadership position within it. Being the chairman of the party is a more specific role that presupposes his membership. Hence, we can infer that he is a member of the political party TOP 09.

The snippet speaks about someone's experience working with Václav Havel and their familiarity with politics, both domestically and internationally, as well as specifically working at the Castle (which could imply Prague Castle, often associated with the President of the Czech Republic). However, there is no mention of the political party "TOP 09" or even the person "Karel Schwarzenberg" in the snippet provided. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the person being discussed is a member of the TOP 09 political party, nor can we even confirm that the person is Karel Schwarzenberg.

The snippet provides information about Mr. Schwarzenberg's political career, mentioning that he was a Senator before taking a place in the lower house and that he has been the Czech foreign minister twice. However, there is no mention of his affiliation with the political party "TOP 09" or any political party at all.

To infer the RDF statement ["Karel Schwarzenberg" - "member of political party" - "TOP 09"], we require explicit information about his membership with the party TOP 09, which is not provided in the snippet. Therefore, based on the information available in the snippet, we cannot confirm his party membership.

Reasoning:
The snippet states that "His involvement in recent years with TOP 09, a party he formally heads..." This phrase clearly indicates that Karel Schwarzenberg is formally the head of TOP 09, which logically implies he is a member of the political party. Therefore, it can be inferred that Karel Schwarzenberg is a member of the political party TOP 09.

The snippet mentions an individual, "Mr. Schwarzenberg" (presumably Karel Schwarzenberg), noting his age and some personal characteristics such as his tendency to nod off in public and his belief that he can handle the responsibilities of a head of state despite his age. However, there is no information provided in the snippet about his political affiliations or the political party to which he might belong. The RDF statement in question asserts that Karel Schwarzenberg is a member of the political party "TOP 09," but there is no mention or implication of this in the snippet provided.

Therefore, based on the information given in the snippet, we cannot infer the RDF statement concerning Karel Schwarzenberg's membership in the "TOP 09" political party. To verify such a statement, additional information or another source that explicitly states his political party affiliation would be needed.

The RDF statement claims that "Karel Schwarzenberg" is a "member of the political party" "TOP 09". However, the snippet provided does not contain any information about Karel Schwarzenberg's political affiliations or membership in any political party, including "TOP 09". The snippet appears to be a quote about an individual's personal experience, understanding, and health condition, which is unrelated to political party membership.

The snippet mentions Karel Schwarzenberg as a prince and the Czech Republic’s foreign minister, also discussing his involvement in presidential elections. However, it does not provide any information about his membership in a political party, specifically the party "TOP 09."

To infer the RDF statement ["Karel Schwarzenberg" - "member of political party" - "TOP 09"], we would need a clear indication that Schwarzenberg is a member of the TOP 09 political party. Since that information is not presented in the snippet, we cannot make this inference.

Reasoning: The snippet provides details about Karel Schwarzenberg's demeanor and his preference for how he is addressed. It gives a glimpse into his personality and his full name and title in German. However, there is no mention of his association with any political party, let alone specifically "TOP 09." In order to infer the RDF statement "Karel Schwarzenberg" - "member of political party" - "TOP 09," we would need explicit information indicating his membership or affiliation with the political party "TOP 09," which is not given in the text. Therefore, based on the snippet alone, the connection between Karel Schwarzenberg and the political party "TOP 09" cannot be established.

The snippet mentions that Karel Schwarzenberg is a "pro-European member of the center-right governing coalition," but it does not specify the political party he is affiliated with. The political party TOP 09 is not mentioned in the snippet, so we cannot conclude that Schwarzenberg is a member of that party based solely on the provided information.

To make a valid inference to the RDF statement ["Karel Schwarzenberg" - "member of political party" - "TOP 09"], the snippet would need to explicitly state that he is a member of TOP 09 or provide information that could only be true if he were a member of TOP 09, which it does not.

The RDF statement is making a claim about the political affiliations of a person, "Karel Schwarzenberg," stating that he is a member of the political party "TOP 09."

The provided snippet, however, does not mention Karel Schwarzenberg at all. It speaks in general terms about the nature of the Czech presidency and the responsibilities associated with the position. There is no information about any individual's political party membership, nor is there any specific mention of "TOP 09."

Since the snippet does not contain any relevant information about Karel Schwarzenberg or his political affiliations, we cannot infer the given RDF statement from the snippet. Additional information would be required to confirm Karel Schwarzenberg’s membership in the TOP 09 party.

The snippet provides information about a political contest where Karel Schwarzenberg is competing against Milos Zeman during the election rounds. It mentions the percentage of votes they each received but does not mention any political party affiliations for either person.

The provided snippet discusses an artist, David Cerny, who speaks to the character traits of Karel Schwarzenberg in a symbolic way, referring to him as a rebel and stubborn, and describes an attempt to rebrand Schwarzenberg's image. However, there is no mention at all of Schwarzenberg's political affiliations or the specific political party he may be a member of.

RDF Statement: ["Karel Schwarzenberg" - "member of political party" - "TOP 09"]

The RDF statement asserts that "Karel Schwarzenberg" is a "member of the political party" known as "TOP 09."

Snippet: The provided text mentions Erik Tabery, a journalist, speaking about the current state of Czech politics and the public mood. It does not mention Karel Schwarzenberg or the political party TOP 09.

Reasoning:
- There is no mention of Karel Schwarzenberg in the snippet.
- The snippet does not reference any political party at all.
- There is no information about anyone's membership in any political party.

Thus, based on the snippet, we cannot draw any conclusions about Karel Schwarzenberg's party affiliation with TOP 09. Additional information explicitly stating the relationship between Karel Schwarzenberg and TOP 09 would be needed to support the RDF statement.

The snippet discusses the general economic and political situation in the Czech Republic, mentioning high unemployment, weak economic growth, and corruption scandals. However, it does not mention Karel Schwarzenberg or the political party "TOP 09." 

To infer the RDF statement ["Karel Schwarzenberg" - "member of political party" - "TOP 09"], the snippet would need to contain information specifically about Karel Schwarzenberg being a member of the "TOP 09" political party.

The snippet describes personal characteristics and challenges faced by Mr. Schwarzenberg but does not mention his political party affiliation or membership.

The snippet does not provide any information about Karel Schwarzenberg's political affiliations or mention the political party "TOP 09." The text only gives a brief insight into Schwarzenberg's mannerisms and the criticism he has faced, along with a note from his aides regarding his behavior.

The snippet states that "He has been linked to three or four different parties on both left and right, from Greens to conservatives," but it does not explicitly name "TOP 09" as one of those parties. Additionally, while the snippet indicates that Karel Schwarzenberg's political affiliations may vary, ("Today he is a conservative, but who knows tomorrow?"), this does not provide specific information about his membership in the TOP 09 party.

For an RDF statement like ["Karel Schwarzenberg" - "member of political party" - "TOP 09"] to be inferred, the snippet would need to include a direct statement such as "Karel Schwarzenberg is a member of the TOP 09 party" or "Schwarzenberg, a leading figure in the TOP 09 party," which is not present in the given text.

Since the snippet does not provide any information about Karel Schwarzenberg or his affiliation with the political party TOP 09, we cannot confirm the RDF statement's accuracy based on the provided snippet.

Reasoning:
The snippet mentions "čestný předseda TOP 09," which translates from Czech to English as "honorary chairman of TOP 09." This implies that Karel Schwarzenberg is associated with the political party TOP 09, having a prominent role within it.

The RDF statement indicates that "Karel Schwarzenberg" is a "member of political party" "TOP 09." The fact that he is described as an honorary chairman of the party indicates that he is indeed a member of this party, allowing us to infer the RDF statement as being correct based on the provided snippet.

However, there is no information given about Karel Schwarzenberg's membership in any political party, let alone the specific party "TOP 09." To infer the RDF statement, the snippet would need to contain explicit information mentioning that Karel Schwarzenberg is a member of the political party "TOP 09," which it does not.

This sentence indicates that Schwarzenberg was nominated by, among others, the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) for the position of Senator. However, being nominated by a political party does not necessarily equate to being a member of that party; candidates can be supported by a party without being a formal member. Further examination of the snippet shows Schwarzenberg's clear affiliation is with the TOP 09 party, which he co-founded: "In May 2010, he was elected as a Member of Parliament for the newly founded pro-European centre-right party TOP 09, gaining the largest number of preference votes."

However, the snippet does not mention Karel Schwarzenberg's marital status nor the name of his spouse. It only discusses a historical event concerning his family and their emigration from Czechoslovakia due to political changes.

Therefore, based on the snippet alone, we have no information about Karel Schwarzenberg's spouse and cannot confirm the RDF statement is true. To verify such a statement, additional information or a different source that explicitly mentions Karel Schwarzenberg's spouse would be necessary.
