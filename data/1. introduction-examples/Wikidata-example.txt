source url: https://www.ask-oracle.com/birth-chart/vaclav-havel/

[INPUT]
Is this RDF true? RDF: ["Václav Havel" - "award received" - "Concordia Prize"]

[OUTPUT]
After verifying, I found that Václav Havel, the former President of the Czech Republic and a renowned playwright, did not receive the Concordia Prize.

Václav Havel received many awards and honors during his lifetime, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Gandhi Peace Prize, and the Václav Havel Human Rights Prize, among others. However, I couldn't find any evidence of him receiving the Concordia Prize.

So, the RDF statement ["Václav Havel" - "award received" - "Concordia Prize"] is actually FALSE.
