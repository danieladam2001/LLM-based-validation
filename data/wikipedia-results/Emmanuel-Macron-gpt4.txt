                <groupText> President (2017–present) Minister of Economy and Industry (2014–2016)
                    Renaissance Emmanuel Jean-Michel Frédéric Macron (French: [emanɥɛl makʁɔ̃]; born
                    21 December 1977) is a French politician who has been President of France since
                    2017. Macron is ex officio one of the two Co-Princes of Andorra. He previously
                    was Minister of Economics, Industry and Digital Affairs under President François
                    Hollande from 2014 to 2016, and as Deputy Secretary-General to the President
                    from 2012 to 2014. He is a founding member of Renaissance, a centrist political
                    party. Born in Amiens, Macron studied philosophy at Paris Nanterre University,
                    later completing a master's degree in public affairs at Sciences Po and
                    graduating from the École nationale d'administration in 2004. He worked as a
                    senior civil servant at the Inspectorate General of Finances and later became an
                    investment banker at Rothschild &amp;amp; Co. Appointed Élysée deputy
                    secretary-general by President François Hollande shortly after his election in
                    May 2012, Macron was one of Hollande's senior advisers. Appointed Minister of
                    Economics, Industry and Digital Affairs in August 2014 in the second Valls
                    government, he led a number of business-friendly reforms. He resigned in August
                    2016, in order to launch his 2017 presidential campaign. A member of the
                    Socialist Party from 2006 to 2009, he ran in the election under the banner of En
                    Marche, a centrist and pro-European political movement he founded in April 2016.
                    Partly as a result of the Fillon affair which sank the Republican nominee
                    François Fillon's chances, Macron topped the ballot in the first round of
                    voting, and was elected President of France on 7 May 2017 with 66.1% of the vote
                    in the second round, defeating Marine Le Pen of the National Front. At the age
                    of 39, he became the youngest president in French history. In the 2017
                    legislative election in June, his party, renamed La République En Marche!
                    (LREM), secured a majority in the National Assembly. He appointed Édouard
                    Philippe as prime minister. When Philippe resigned in 2020, Macron appointed
                    Jean Castex to replace him. Macron was elected to a second term in the 2022
                    presidential election, again defeating Le Pen, thus becoming the first French
                    presidential candidate to win reelection since Jacques Chirac defeated
                    Jean-Marie Le Pen in 2002. However, in the 2022 legislative election, his
                    centrist coalition lost its absolute majority, resulting in a hung parliament
                    and the formation of France's first minority government since the fall of the
                    Bérégovoy government in 1993. Macron's current prime minister is Gabriel Attal,
                    youngest head of government in French history and first openly gay man to hold
                    the office, whom he appointed in January 2024 to replace Élisabeth Borne, the
                    second female Prime Minister of France, after a major government crisis. During
                    his presidency, Macron has overseen several reforms to labour laws, taxation,
                    and pensions; and has pursued a renewable energy transition. Dubbed "president
                    of the rich" by political opponents, increasing protests against his domestic
                    reforms and demanding his resignation marked the first years of his presidency,
                    culminating in 2018–2020 with the yellow vests protests and the pension reform
                    strike. From 2020, he led France's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and
                    vaccination rollout. In 2023, the government of his prime minister, Élisabeth
                    Borne, passed legislation raising the retirement age from 62 to 64; the pension
                    reforms proved controversial and led to public sector strikes and violent
                    protests. In foreign policy, he called for reforms to the European Union (EU)
                    and signed bilateral treaties with Italy and Germany. Macron conducted €42
                    billion in trade and business agreements with China during the China–United
                    States trade war and oversaw a dispute with Australia and the United States over
                    the AUKUS security pact. He continued Opération Chammal in the war against the
                    Islamic State and joined in the international condemnation of the Russian
                    invasion of Ukraine. Macron was born on 21 December 1977 in Amiens. He is the
                    son of Françoise Macron (née Noguès), a physician, and Jean-Michel Macron,
                    professor of neurology at the University of Picardy.[1][2] The couple divorced
                    in 2010. He has two siblings, Laurent, born in 1979, and Estelle, born in 1982.
                    Françoise and Jean-Michel's first child was stillborn.[3] The Macron family
                    legacy is traced back to the village of Authie, Picardy.[4] One of his paternal
                    great-grandfathers, George William Robertson, was English, and was born in
                    Bristol, United Kingdom.[5][6] His maternal grandparents, Jean and Germaine
                    Noguès (née Arribet), are from the Pyrenean town of Bagnères-de-Bigorre,
                    Gascony.[7] He commonly visited Bagnères-de-Bigorre to visit his grandmother
                    Germaine, whom he called "Manette".[8] Macron associates his enjoyment of
                    reading[9] and his leftward political leanings to Germaine, who, after coming
                    from a modest upbringing of a stationmaster father and a housekeeping mother,
                    became a teacher then a principal, and died in 2013.[10] Although raised in a
                    non-religious family, Macron was baptised a Catholic at his own request at age
                    12; he is agnostic today.[11] Macron was educated mainly at the Jesuit institute
                    Lycée la Providence[12] in Amiens[13] before his parents sent him to finish his
                    last year of school[14] at the elite Lycée Henri-IV in Paris, where he completed
                    the high school curriculum and the undergraduate program with a "Bac S, Mention
                    Très bien". At the same time, he was nominated for the "Concours général" (most
                    selective national level high school competition) in French literature and
                    received his diploma for his piano studies at Amiens Conservatory.[15] His
                    parents sent him to Paris due to their alarm at the bond he had formed with
                    Brigitte Auzière, a married teacher with three children at Jésuites de la
                    Providence, who later became his wife.[16] In Paris, Macron twice failed to gain
                    entry to the École normale supérieure.[17][18][19] He instead studied philosophy
                    at the University of Paris-Ouest Nanterre La Défense, obtaining a DEA degree (a
                    master level degree), with a thesis on Machiavelli and Hegel.[12][20] Around
                    1999 Macron worked as an editorial assistant to Paul Ricoeur, the French
                    Protestant philosopher who was then writing his last major work, La Mémoire,
                    l'Histoire, l'Oubli. Macron worked mainly on the notes and bibliography.[21][22]
                    Macron became a member of the editorial board of the literary magazine
                    Esprit.[23] Macron did not perform national service because he was pursuing his
                    graduate studies. Born in December 1977, he belonged to the last cohort for whom
                    military service was mandatory.[24][25] Macron obtained a master's degree in
                    public affairs at Sciences Po, majoring in "Public Guidance and Economy" before
                    training for a senior civil service career at the selective École nationale
                    d'administration (ENA), training at the French Embassy in Nigeria[26] and at the
                    prefecture of Oise before graduating in 2004.[27] After graduating from ENA in
                    2004, Macron became an Inspector in the Inspection générale des finances (IGF),
                    a branch of the Finance Ministry.[21] Macron was mentored by Jean-Pierre Jouyet,
                    the then-head of the IGF.[28] During his time as an Inspector of Finances,
                    Macron gave lectures during the summer at the "prep'ENA" (a special cram school
                    for the ENA entrance examination) at IPESUP, an elite private school
                    specializing in preparation for the entrance examinations of the Grandes écoles,
                    such as HEC or Sciences Po.[29][30][31] In 2006, Laurence Parisot offered him
                    the job of managing director for Mouvement des Entreprises de France, the
                    largest employer federation in France, but he declined.[32] In August 2007,
                    Macron was appointed deputy rapporteur for Jacques Attali's "Commission to
                    Unleash French Growth".[13] In 2008, Macron paid €50,000 to buy himself out of
                    his government contract.[33] He then became an investment banker in a
                    highly-paid position at Rothschild &amp;amp; Cie Banque.[34][35] In March 2010, he
                    was appointed to the Attali Commission as a member.[36] In September 2008,
                    Macron left his job as an Inspector of Finances and took a position at
                    Rothschild &amp;amp; Cie Banque.[37] Macron left the government when Nicolas Sarkozy
                    became president. He was originally offered the job by François Henrot. His
                    first responsibility at the bank was assisting with the acquisition of Cofidis
                    by Crédit Mutuel Nord Europe.[38] Macron formed a relationship with Alain Minc,
                    a businessman on the supervisory board of Le Monde.[39] In 2010, Macron was
                    promoted to partner with the bank after working on the recapitalization of Le
                    Monde and the acquisition by Atos of Siemens IT Solutions and Services.[40] In
                    the same year, Macron was put in charge of Nestlé's acquisition of Pfizer's
                    infant nutrition division for €9 billion, which made him a millionaire.[41][42]
                    In February 2012, Macron advised businessman Philippe Tillous-Borde, the CEO of
                    the Avril Group.[43] Macron reported that he had earned €2 million between
                    December 2010 and May 2012.[44] Official documents show that between 2009 and
                    2013, Macron had earned almost €3 million.[45] He left Rothschild &amp;amp; Cie in
                    2012.[46][47] In his youth, Macron worked for the Citizen and Republican
                    Movement for two years, but he never applied to be a member.[48][44] Macron was
                    an assistant for Mayor Georges Sarre of the 11th arrondissement of Paris during
                    his time at Sciences Po.[49] Macron had been a member of the Socialist Party
                    since he was 24,[50] but last renewed his membership for the period
                    2006–2009.[51] </groupText>

                <groupText>Macron met François Hollande through Jean-Pierre Jouyet in 2006 and
                    joined his staff in 2010.[50] In 2007, Macron attempted to run for a seat in the
                    National Assembly in Picardy under the Socialist Party label in the 2007
                    legislative elections; however, his application was declined.[52] Macron was
                    offered the chance to be the deputy chief of staff to Prime Minister François
                    Fillon in 2010, though he declined.[53] On 15 May 2012, Macron became the deputy
                    secretary-general of the Élysée, a senior role in President François Hollande's
                    staff.[54][27] Macron served with Nicolas Revel. He served under the
                    secretary-general, Pierre-René Lemas. During the summer of 2012, Macron put
                    forward a proposal that would increase the 35-hour work week to 37 hours until
                    2014. He also tried to hold back the large tax increases on the highest earners
                    that were planned by the government. Hollande refused Macron's proposals.[55] In
                    2013, his was one of the deciding votes against regulating the salaries of
                    CEOs.[56] Nicolas Revel, the other deputy secretary-general of the Élysée
                    opposed Macron on a proposed budget responsibility pact favoured by the
                    Medef.[57] On 10 June 2014, it was announced that Macron had resigned from his
                    role and was replaced by Laurence Boone.[58] Reasons given for his departure
                    included his disappointment at not being included in the first Government of
                    Manuel Valls and his frustration with his lack of influence on the reforms
                    proposed by the government.[57] This was following the appointment of
                    Jean-Pierre Jouyet as chief of staff.[59] Jouyet said that Macron left to
                    "continue personal aspirations"[60] and create his own financial consultancy
                    firm.[61] It was later reported that he was planning to create an investment
                    firm that would attempt to fund educational projects.[48] Shortly afterwards he
                    was hired as a research fellow at the University of Berlin with the help of
                    businessman Alain Minc. He had also sought a position at Harvard University.[62]
                    Offered a chance to be a candidate in the municipal elections in 2014 in his
                    hometown of Amiens, Macron declined,[63] leading François Hollande to reject
                    Manuel Valls's idea of appointing him Budget Minister, as he had never been
                    elected to public office.[59] He was appointed as the Minister of Economics and
                    Industry in the second Valls Cabinet on 26 August 2014, replacing Arnaud
                    Montebourg.[64] He was the youngest Minister of Economics since Valéry Giscard
                    d'Estaing in 1962.[65] Macron was branded by the media as the "Anti-Montebourg"
                    due to being pro-EU and much more moderate, while Montebourg was eurosceptic and
                    left-wing.[66] As Minister of Economics, Macron was at the forefront of pushing
                    through business-friendly reforms. On 17 February 2015, prime minister Manuel
                    Valls pushed Macron's signature law package through a reluctant parliament using
                    the special 49.3 procedure.[67] Macron increased the French share in the company
                    Renault from 15% to 20% and then enforced the Florange law which grants double
                    voting rights on shares registered for more than two years unless two-thirds of
                    shareholders vote to overturn it.[68] This gave the French state a minority
                    share in the company though Macron later stated that the government would limit
                    its powers within Renault.[69] Macron was widely criticized for being unable to
                    prevent the closing down of an Ecopla factory in Isère.[70] In August 2015,
                    Macron said that he was no longer a member of the Socialist Party and was an
                    independent.[51] A law which had originally been sponsored by Arnaud Montebourg
                    before he left the government, and which had focused on "purchasing power", grew
                    into the Macron law [fr], a grab bag of measures liberalizing laws prohibiting
                    work on Sunday and at night; restrictions on coaches for public transportation;
                    regulations for debt collectors, barristers and auctioneers; and rules governing
                    the rental of equipment by the military from private companies. The law also
                    sought to simplify many government procedures, such as that for obtaining a
                    driving licence.[71][72] Manuel Valls, fearing that it would not pass in the
                    National Assembly, decided to push the law through with the 49.3
                    procedure[73][67] and so it was adopted on 10 April 2015.[74] Estimates of the
                    increase in GDP the law might generate ranged from 0.3% to 0.5%.[75][76] Macron
                    first became known to the French public after his appearance on the French TV
                    programme Des Paroles Et Des Actes in March 2015.[77] Before forming his
                    political party En Marche!, he gave a number of speeches, his first one in March
                    2015 in Val-de-Marne.[78] He threatened to leave Manuel Valls' second government
                    over the proposed removal of dual-nationality from terrorists.[79][80] He also
                    took various foreign trips, including one to Israel where he spoke on the
                    advancement of digital technology.[81] Tensions around the question of Macron's
                    loyalty to the Valls government and Hollande increased when they turned down a
                    bill he put forward dubbed "Macron 2", which had a larger scope than his
                    original law.[82][83] Macron was given the chance to help draft into the El
                    Khomri law and put specific parts of "Macron 2" into the law though El Khomri
                    was able to overturn these with the help of other ministers.[citation
                    needed][clarification needed] Amid tensions and deterioration of relations with
                    the current government, Macron founded an independent political party, En
                    Marche, in Amiens on 6 April 2016.[84] A liberal,[85] progressive[86][87]
                    political movement that gathered huge media coverage when it was first
                    established,[88] the party and Macron were both reprimanded by President
                    Hollande and the question of Macron's loyalty to the government was
                    raised.[89][90] Several MEPs spoke out in support for the movement[91] though
                    the majority of the Socialist Party spoke against En Marche including Manuel
                    Valls,[92] Michel Sapin,[93] Axelle Lemaire and Christian Eckert.[94] In June
                    2016, support for Macron and his movement, En Marche, began to grow in the media
                    with Libération reporting that L'Express, Les Échos, Le 1 [fr], and L'Opinion
                    had begun to support him.[95] Following several controversies surrounding trade
                    unionists and their protests, Acrimed [fr] reported that major newspapers began
                    to run front-page stories about Macron and En Marche.[96] Criticized by both the
                    far-left and the far-right, these pro-Macron influencers in the press were
                    dubbed "Macronites".[97][98] In May 2016, Orleans mayor Olivier Carré invited
                    Macron to the festival commemorating the 587th anniversary of Joan of Arc's
                    efforts during the Siege of Orléans.[99][100] LCI reported that Macron was
                    trying to take back the symbol of Joan of Arc from the far-right.[101] Macron
                    later went to Puy du Fou and declared he was "not a socialist" in a speech amid
                    rumours he was going to leave the current government.[102] On 30 August 2016,
                    Macron resigned from the government ahead of the 2017 presidential
                    election,[103][104] to devote himself to his En Marche movement.[105][106] There
                    had been rising tensions and several reports that he had wanted to leave the
                    Valls government since early 2015.[107] He initially planned to leave after the
                    cancellation[clarification needed] of his "Macron 2" law[83] but decided to stay
                    on temporarily after a meeting with President François Hollande.[108] Michel
                    Sapin was announced as Macron's replacement,[109] while Hollande said he felt
                    Macron had "methodically betrayed" him.[110] An IFOP poll showed that 84% of
                    those surveyed agreed with his decision to resign.[111] Macron first showed his
                    intention to run by forming En Marche, but following his resignation from the
                    government, he was able to dedicate more time to his movement. He first
                    announced that he was considering running for president in April 2016,[112] and
                    after his resignation from the position of economy minister, media sources began
                    to identify patterns in his fundraising indicating he would run.[113] In October
                    2016, Macron criticized Hollande's goal of being a "normal" president, saying
                    that France needed a more "Jupiterian presidency".[114] On 16 November 2016,
                    Macron formally declared his candidacy for the French presidency after months of
                    speculation. In his announcement speech, he called for a "democratic revolution"
                    and promised to "unblock France".[115] He had expressed hope that Hollande would
                    run several months earlier, saying that—as the sitting president—he was the
                    legitimate Socialist party candidate.[116][117] Macron's book Révolution was
                    published on 24 November 2016 and reached fifth position on the French
                    best-seller list in December 2016.[118] Shortly after announcing his run,
                    Jean-Christophe Cambadélis and Manuel Valls both asked Macron to run in the
                    Socialist Party presidential primary, which he ultimately refused to
                    do.[119][120] Jean-Christophe Cambadélis began to threaten to exclude members
                    who associated or supported Macron following Lyon mayor Gérard Collomb throwing
                    his support behind him.[121] </groupText>

                <groupText>Macron's campaign, headed by French economist Sophie Ferracci,[122]
                    announced in December 2016 that it had raised 3.7 million euros in
                    donations,[123] three times the budget of then-front runner Alain Juppé.[124]
                    Macron came under criticism from several individuals, including Benoît Hamon−who
                    requested he reveal a list of his donors and accused him of conflicts of
                    interest due to the time he spent at Rothschilds,[125] which Macron dismissed as
                    "demagogy".[126] Journalists Marion L'Hour and Frédéric Says later reported that
                    he had spent €120,000 on setting up dinners and meetings with various
                    personalities within the media and in French popular culture while at
                    Bercy.[127] Christian Jacob and Philippe Vigier accused him of using this money
                    to campaign without campaigning.[128] His successor, Michel Sapin, saw nothing
                    illegal about his actions, saying that he had the right to spend the funds.[129]
                    Macron called the allegations "defamatory" and said that none of the ministerial
                    budget had been spent on his party.[127] Macron's campaign enjoyed considerable
                    coverage from the media.[130] Mediapart reported that over fifty magazine covers
                    were dedicated purely to him.[131] Friends with the owners of Le Monde[132] and
                    Claude Perdiel, the former owner of Nouvel Observateur,[133] he was labelled the
                    "media candidate" by the far-left and far-right and was viewed as such in
                    opinion polls.[134][135][136] Many observers compared his campaign to a product
                    being sold[137] due to Maurice Lévy, a former Publicis CEO, using marketing
                    tactics to try to advance his presidential ambitions.[138][139] The magazine
                    Marianne reported that BFM TV, owned by Patrick Drahi, broadcast more coverage
                    of Macron than of all the other main candidates combined.[140] Marianne
                    speculated that this might be due to the campaigns links with Drahi through
                    Bernard Mourad.[141][142] François Bayrou, with whom Macron had been compared,
                    announced he was not going to stand in the presidential election and instead
                    formed an electoral alliance with Macron,[143][144] whose poll ratings began to
                    rise. After several legal issues surrounding François Fillon were publicized,
                    Macron overtook him in the polls to become the front-runner.[145][146] Macron
                    attracted criticism for the time taken to spell out a formal program during his
                    campaign; despite declaring in November that he had still not released a
                    complete set of proposals by February, attracting both attacks from critics and
                    concern among allies and supporters.[147] He eventually laid out his 150-page
                    formal program on 2 March, publishing it online and discussing it at a marathon
                    press conference that day.[148] Macron accumulated a wide array of supporters,
                    securing endorsements from François Bayrou of the Democratic Movement (MoDem),
                    MEP Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the ecologist candidate François de Rugy of the primary
                    of the left, and Socialist MP Richard Ferrand, secretary-general of En Marche,
                    as well as numerous others – many of them from the Socialist Party, but also a
                    significant number of centrist and centre-right politicians.[149] The Grand
                    Mosque of Paris urged French Muslims to vote en masse for Macron.[150] On 23
                    April 2017, Macron received the most votes in the first round of the
                    presidential election, with more than 8 million votes (24%) and faced Marine Le
                    Pen in the second round, with the support of former candidates François Fillon
                    and Benoît Hamon[151] and the sitting president François Hollande.[152] Many
                    foreign politicians supported Macron in his bid against right-wing populist
                    candidate Marine Le Pen, including European Commission President Jean-Claude
                    Juncker, German Chancellor Angela Merkel,[153] and former US President Barack
                    Obama.[154] A debate was arranged between Macron and Le Pen on 3 May 2017. The
                    debate lasted for two hours and opinion polls showed that he was perceived to
                    have won.[155] In March 2017, Macron's digital campaign manager, Mounir
                    Mahjoubi, told Britain's Sky News that Russia is behind "high level attacks" on
                    Macron, and said that its state media are "the first source of false
                    information". He said: "We are accusing RT (formerly known as Russia Today) and
                    Sputnik News (of being) the first source of false information shared about our
                    candidate ...".[156] Two days before the French presidential election on 7 May,
                    it was reported that nine gigabytes of Macron's campaign emails had been
                    anonymously posted to Pastebin, a document-sharing site. These documents were
                    then spread onto the imageboard 4chan, which led to the hashtag "#macronleaks"
                    trending on Twitter.[157][158] In a statement the same evening, Macron's
                    political movement, En Marche, said: "The En Marche movement has been the victim
                    of a massive and coordinated hack this evening which has given rise to the
                    diffusion on social media of various internal information".[159] Macron's
                    campaign had previously been presented a report in March 2017 by the Japanese
                    cyber security firm Trend Micro detailing how En Marche had been the target of
                    phishing attacks.[160] Trend Micro said that the group conducting these attacks
                    was the Russian hacking group Fancy Bear, also accused of hacking the Democratic
                    National Committee on 22 July 2016.[160] 21,075 verified emails and another
                    50,773 emails it could not verify were released in July 2017 by WikiLeaks.[161]
                    This followed Le Pen accusing Macron of tax avoidance.[162] On 7 May 2017,
                    Macron was elected President of France with 66.1% of the vote to Marine Le Pen's
                    33.9%. The election had record abstention at 25.4%, and 8% of ballots were blank
                    or spoiled.[163] Macron resigned from his role as president of En Marche[164]
                    and Catherine Barbaroux became interim leader.[165] Macron qualified for the
                    runoff after the first round of the election on 23 April 2017. He won the second
                    round of the presidential election on 7 May 2017 by a landslide according to
                    preliminary results,[166] making the candidate of the National Front, Marine Le
                    Pen, concede.[167] At 39, he became the youngest president in French history and
                    the youngest French head of state since Napoleon.[168][169] He is also the first
                    president of France born after the establishment of the Fifth Republic in 1958.
                    Macron formally became president on 14 May.[170] He appointed Patrick Strzoda as
                    his chief of staff[171] and Ismaël Emelien as his special advisor for strategy,
                    communication and speeches.[172] On 15 May, he appointed Édouard Philippe of the
                    Republicans as Prime Minister.[173][174] On the same day, he made his first
                    official foreign visit, meeting in Berlin with Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of
                    Germany. The two leaders emphasised the importance of France–Germany relations
                    to the European Union.[175] They agreed to draw up a "common road map" for
                    Europe, insisting that neither was against changes to the Treaties of the
                    European Union.[176] In the 2017 legislative election, Macron's party La
                    République En Marche and its Democratic Movement allies secured a comfortable
                    majority, winning 350 seats out of 577.[177] After the Republicans emerged as
                    the winners of the Senate elections, government spokesman Christophe Castaner
                    stated the elections were a "failure" for his party.[178] On 3 July 2020, Macron
                    appointed the centre-right Jean Castex as the Prime Minister of France. Castex,
                    described as a social conservative, was a member of the Republicans.[179] The
                    appointment was described as "doubling down on a course that is widely seen as
                    centre-right in economic terms".[180] In his first few months as president,
                    Macron pressed for the enactment of a package of reforms on public ethics,
                    labour laws, taxes, and law enforcement agency powers.[citation needed] In
                    response to Penelopegate, the National Assembly passed a part of Macron's
                    proposed law to stop mass corruption in French politics by July 2017, banning
                    elected representatives from hiring family members.[181] Meanwhile, the second
                    part of the law scrapping a constituency fund was scheduled for voting after
                    Senate objections.[182] Macron's plan to give his wife an official role within
                    government came under fire with criticisms ranging from its being undemocratic
                    to what critics perceive as a contradiction to his fight against nepotism.[183]
                    Following an online petition of nearly 290,000 signatures on change.org Macron
                    abandoned the plan.[184] On 9 August, the National Assembly adopted the bill on
                    public ethics, a key theme of Macron's campaign, after debates on the scrapping
                    the constituency funds.[185] Macron aims to shift union-management relations
                    away from the adversarial lines of the current French system and toward a more
                    flexible, consensus-driven system modelled after Germany and
                    Scandinavia.[186][187] He has also pledged to act against companies employing
                    cheaper labour from eastern Europe and in return affecting jobs of French
                    workers, what he has termed as "social dumping". Under the Posted Workers
                    Directive 1996, eastern European workers can be employed for a limited time at
                    the salary level in eastern European countries, which has led to dispute between
                    the EU states.[188] The French government announced the proposed changes to
                    France's labour rules ("Code du Travail"), being among the first steps taken by
                    Macron and his government to galvanize the French economy.[189] Macron's reform
                    efforts have encountered resistance from some French trade unions.[190] The
                    largest trade union, the CFDT, has taken a conciliatory approach to Macron's
                    push and has engaged in negotiations with the president, while the more militant
                    CGT is more hostile to reforms.[186][187] Macron's labour minister, Muriel
                    Pénicaud, is overseeing the effort.[191] </groupText>

                <groupText>The National Assembly including the Senate approved the proposal,
                    allowing the government to loosen the labour laws after negotiations with unions
                    and employers' groups.[192] The reforms, which were discussed with unions, limit
                    payouts for dismissals deemed unfair and give companies greater freedom to hire
                    and fire employees as well as to define acceptable working conditions. The
                    president signed five decrees reforming the labour rules on 22 September.[193]
                    Government figures released in October 2017 revealed that during the legislative
                    push to reform the labour code, the unemployment rate had dropped 1.8%, the
                    biggest since 2001.[194] Speaking on refugees and, specifically, the Calais
                    Jungle, Macron said on 16 January 2018 that he would not allow another refugee
                    camp to form in Paris before outlining the government policy towards immigration
                    and asylum.[195] He has also announced plans to speed up asylum applications and
                    deportations but give refugees better housing.[196] On 23 June 2018, President
                    Macron said: "The reality is that Europe is not experiencing a migration crisis
                    of the same magnitude as the one it experienced in 2015", "a country like Italy
                    has not at all the same migratory pressure as last year. The crisis we are
                    experiencing today in Europe is a political crisis".[197] In November 2019,
                    Macron introduced new immigration rules to restrict the number of refugees
                    reaching France, while stating to "take back control" of the immigration
                    policy.[198] Pierre de Villiers, then-Chief of the General Staff of the Armies,
                    stepped down on 19 July 2017 following a confrontation with Macron.[199] De
                    Villiers cited the military budget cut of €850 million as the main reason he was
                    stepping down. Le Monde later reported that De Villiers told a parliamentary
                    group, "I will not let myself be fucked like this."[200] Macron named François
                    Lecointre as De Villiers' replacement.[201] Macron's government presented its
                    first budget on 27 September, the terms of which reduced taxes as well as
                    spending to bring the public deficit in line with the EU's fiscal rules.[202]
                    The budget replaced the wealth tax with one targeting real estate, fulfilling
                    Macron's campaign pledge to scrap the wealth tax.[203] Before it was replaced,
                    the tax collected up to 1.5% of the wealth of French residents whose global
                    worth exceeded €1.3m.[204] In February 2018, Macron announced a plan to offer
                    voluntary redundancy in an attempt to further cut jobs from the French civil
                    service.[205] In December 2019, Macron announced that he would scrap the
                    20th-century pension system and introduce a single national pension system
                    managed by the state.[206] In January 2020, after weeks of public transport
                    shutdown and vandalism across Paris against the new pension plan, Macron
                    compromised on the plan by revising the retirement age.[207] In February, the
                    pension overhaul was adopted by decree using Article 49 of the French
                    constitution.[208] However, on 16 March 2020, Macron announced that the draft
                    legislation would be pulled as France went into lockdown to slow the spread of
                    COVID-19.[209] In July 2017, the Senate approved its first reading of a
                    controversial bill with stricter anti-terror laws, a campaign pledge of Macron.
                    The National Assembly voted on 3 October to pass t bill 415–127, with 19
                    abstentions. Interior Minister Gérard Collomb described France as being "still
                    in a state of war" ahead of the vote, with the 1 October Marseille stabbing
                    having taken place two days prior. The Senate then passed the bill on its second
                    reading by a 244–22 margin on 18 October. Later that day Macron stated that 13
                    terror plots had been foiled since early 2017. The law replaced the state of
                    emergency in France and made some of its provisions permanent.[210] The bill was
                    criticized by human rights advocates. A public poll by Le Figaro showed 57% of
                    the respondents approved of it even though 62% thought it would encroach on
                    personal freedoms.[211] The law gives authorities expanded power to search
                    homes, restrict movement, close places of worship,[212] and search areas around
                    train stations and international ports and airports. It was passed after
                    modifications to address concerns about civil liberties. The most punitive
                    measures will be reviewed annually and were scheduled to lapse by the end of
                    2020.[213] The bill was signed into law by Macron on 30 October 2017. He
                    announced that starting 1 November, it would bring an end to the state of
                    emergency.[214] Visiting Corsica in February 2018, Macron sparked controversy
                    when he rejected Corsican nationalist wishes for Corsican as an official
                    language[215] but offered to recognize Corsica in the French constitution.[216]
                    Macron also proposed a plan to "reorganise" the Islamic religion in France
                    saying: "We are working on the structuring of Islam in France and also on how to
                    explain it, which is extremely important – my goal is to rediscover what lies at
                    the heart of laïcité, the possibility of being able to believe as not to
                    believe, in order to preserve national cohesion and the possibility of having
                    free consciousness." He declined to reveal further information about the
                    plan.[217] Macron attended the 2017 Brussels summit on 25 May 2017, his first
                    NATO summit as president of France. At the summit, he met US President Donald
                    Trump for the first time. The meeting was widely publicized due to a handshake
                    between the two of them, characterized as a "power-struggle".[218][219] On 29
                    May 2017, Macron met with Vladimir Putin at the Palace of Versailles. The
                    meeting sparked controversy when Macron denounced Russia Today and Sputnik,
                    accusing the news agencies of being "organs of influence and propaganda, of
                    lying propaganda".[220][221] Macron also urged cooperation in the conflict
                    against ISIS and warned that France would respond with force in Syria if
                    chemical weapons were used.[222] In response to the chemical attack in Douma,
                    Syria in 2018, Macron directed French participation in airstrikes against Syrian
                    government sites, coordinated with the United States and the United
                    Kingdom.[223][224] In his first major foreign policy speech on 29 August,
                    President Macron stated that fighting Islamist terrorism at home and abroad was
                    France's top priority. Macron urged a tough international stance to pressure
                    North Korea into negotiations, on the same day it fired a missile over Japan. He
                    also affirmed his support for the Iranian nuclear deal and criticized
                    Venezuela's government as a "dictatorship". He added that he would announce his
                    new initiatives on the future of the European Union after the German elections
                    in September.[225] At the 56th Munich Security Conference in February, Macron
                    presented his 10-year vision policy to strengthen the European Union. Macron
                    remarked that larger budget, integrated capital markets, effective defence
                    policy and quick decision-making held the key for Europe. He added that reliance
                    on NATO and especially the US and the UK was not good for Europe, and a dialogue
                    must be established with Russia.[226] Prior to the 45th G7 summit in Biarritz,
                    France, Macron hosted Vladimir Putin at the Fort de Brégançon, stating that
                    "Russia fully belongs within a Europe of values."[227] At the summit itself,
                    Macron was invited to attend on the margins by Iranian Foreign Minister Javad
                    Zarif.[clarification needed] Macron, who "attempted a high-risk diplomatic
                    gambit", thought that the Foreign Minister of Iran might be able to defuse the
                    tense situation over the Iranian nuclear programme in spite of the recent uptick
                    in tensions between the Islamic Republic and the United States and Britain.[228]
                    In March 2019, at a time when China–U.S. economic relations were troubled with a
                    trade war underway, Macron and Chinese leader Xi Jinping signed a series of 15
                    large-scale trade and business agreements totaling 40 billion euros (US$45
                    billion) which covered many sectors over a period of years.[229] This included a
                    €30 billion purchase of airplanes from Airbus. Going beyond aviation, the new
                    trade agreement covered French exports of chicken, a French-built offshore wind
                    farm in China, a Franco-Chinese cooperation fund, as well as billions of Euros
                    of co-financing between BNP Paribas and the Bank of China. Other plans included
                    billions of euros to be spent on modernizing Chinese factories, as well as new
                    ship building.[230] In July 2020, Macron called for sanctions against Turkey for
                    violating Greece's and Cyprus' sovereignty, saying it is "not acceptable that
                    the maritime space of (EU) member states be violated and threatened."[231] He
                    also criticized Turkish military intervention in Libya.[232][233] Macron said
                    that "We have the right to expect more from Turkey than from Russia, given that
                    it is a member of NATO."[234] In 2021, Macron was reported as saying Northern
                    Ireland was not truly part of the United Kingdom following disputes with UK
                    Prime Minister Boris Johnson over implementations of the Northern Ireland
                    protocol.[235] He later denied this, saying he was referring to the fact that
                    Great Britain is separated from Northern Ireland by sea in reference to the
                    Irish Sea border.[236][237] </groupText>

                <groupText>French-U.S. relations became tense in September 2021 due to fallout from
                    the AUKUS security pact between the United States, the United Kingdom, and
                    Australia. The security pact is directed at countering Chinese power in the
                    Indo-Pacific region. As part of the agreement, the U.S. agreed to provide
                    nuclear-powered submarines to Australia. After entering into AUKUS, the
                    Australian government canceled an agreement that it had made with France for the
                    provision of French conventionally powered submarines, angering the French
                    government.[238] On 17 September, France recalled its ambassadors from Australia
                    and the US for consultations.[239] Despite tension in the past, France had never
                    before withdrawn its ambassador to the United States.[240] After a call between
                    Macron and U.S. President Joe Biden on request from the latter, the two leaders
                    agreed to reduce bilateral tensions, and the White House acknowledged the crisis
                    could have been averted if there had been open consultations between
                    allies.[241][242][unreliable source?] On 26 November 2021, Macron and Italian
                    Prime Minister Mario Draghi signed the Quirinal Treaty at the Quirinal Palace in
                    Rome.[243] The treaty aimed to promote the convergence and coordination of
                    French and Italian positions in matters of European and foreign policies,
                    security and defence, migration policy, economy, education, research, culture
                    and cross-border cooperation.[244] During the prelude to the 2022 Russian
                    invasion of Ukraine, Macron spoke face-to-face and on the phone to Russian
                    President Vladimir Putin.[245] During Macron's campaign for the re-election,
                    nearly two months after the Russian invasion began, Macron called on European
                    leaders to maintain dialogue with Putin.[246] According to an IFOP poll for Le
                    Journal du Dimanche, Macron started his five-year term with a 62% approval
                    rating,[247][248] which rose to 64% by 24 June.[249] One month later, Macron
                    suffered a 10% point drop in popularity, the largest at the beginning of a term
                    for any president since Jacques Chirac in 1995, and by August, his popularity
                    had fallen off 24 percentage points since June.[250] This was attributed to his
                    recent confrontations with former Chief of Defence Staff Pierre de
                    Villiers,[251] the nationalization of the Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard
                    owned by the bankrupt STX Offshore &amp; Shipbuilding,[252] and a reduction in
                    housing benefits.[253] By the end of September 2017, seven out of ten
                    respondents said that they believed Emmanuel Macron was respecting his campaign
                    promises,[254][255] though a majority felt that the policies the government was
                    putting forward were "unfair".[256] Macron's popularity fell sharply again in
                    2018, reaching about 25% by the end of November during the yellow vests
                    movement.[257][unreliable source?] During the COVID-19 pandemic in France, his
                    popularity increased, reaching 50% at its highest in July 2020.[258][259] On 18
                    July 2018, Le Monde revealed in an article that a member of Macron's staff
                    Alexandre Benalla posed as a police officer and beat a protester during May Day
                    demonstrations in Paris earlier in the year and was suspended for a period of 15
                    days before only being internally demoted. The Élysée failed to refer the case
                    to the public prosecutor and a preliminary investigation into the case was not
                    opened until the day after the publication of the article, and the lenient
                    penalty served by Benalla raised questions within the opposition about whether
                    the executive deliberately chose not to inform the public prosecutor as required
                    under the code of criminal procedure.[260] In the 2022 election, Macron was the
                    first incumbent to be re-elected since Jacques Chirac defeated Jean-Marie Le Pen
                    in the 2002 election.[261] Macron again defeated Marine Le Pen in the runoff,
                    this time by a closer margin, with 58.55% of the votes to Le Pen's 41.45%.[262]
                    Due to near-record abstentions, this represented 38.52% of registered voters,
                    the lowest figure since Georges Pompidou's 37.5% in 1969.[263] The French
                    far-right received their highest vote total since the start of the French
                    Republic, with nationalist candidates (Le Pen, Zemmour and Dupont-Aignan)
                    winning 32.3% of the votes in the first round and Le Pen achieving a record
                    41.5% of the votes in the second round.[citation needed] Though Macron's second
                    inauguration took place on 7 May 2022, his second presidential term officially
                    began on 14 May 2022. On 16 May 2022, Prime Minister Jean Castex resigned after
                    22 months as head of government. The same day, President Macron appointed
                    Élisabeth Borne at the Hôtel Matignon, thus making her the second female PM in
                    French history after Édith Cresson between 1991 and 1992. She then formed a new
                    government on 20 May 2022. In June 2022, one month into his second term, less
                    than two weeks before the end of the French presidency of the Council of the EU
                    and days after he called for voters to hand him a "solid majority" in a
                    controversial 'tarmac speech',[264] Macron lost his parliamentary majority and
                    was returned a hung parliament in the second round of the 2022 legislative
                    election:[265] Macron's presidential coalition, which had a 115-seat majority
                    going into the election, failed to reach the threshold of 289 seats needed to
                    command an overall majority in the National Assembly, retaining only 251 out of
                    the 346 it had held in the previous Assembly, and falling 38 short of an
                    absolute majority.[266] Crucially, three close political allies to President
                    Macron were defeated in the elections: incumbent President of the National
                    Assembly Richard Ferrand, Macron's own LREM parliamentary party leader
                    Christophe Castaner and MoDem parliamentary group leader Patrick Mignola, thus
                    effectively "decapitating" Macron's parliamentary bloc leadership and further
                    weakening the President's political position in hung parliament territory.[267]
                    Three government ministers resigned after losing their seats: Justine Bénin
                    (junior minister for the Sea), Brigitte Bourguignon (Minister for Health and
                    Prevention) and Amélie de Montchalin (Minister for Ecological Transition).[268]
                    Macron's government, still led by Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne, was reshuffled
                    in early July 2022 and continued as a minority administration, after talks with
                    opposition leaders to form a stable majority government failed.[269] Macron's
                    second presidential term began with two significant political controversies.
                    Hours after the new Borne cabinet was announced, rape accusations against newly
                    appointed Minister for Solidarity Damien Abad were made public,[270] and on 28
                    May, the handling of the 2022 UEFA Champions League final chaos at the Stade de
                    France in Saint-Denis drew criticism at home and abroad.[271] Despite its
                    minority status in the legislature after the 2022 legislative election, Macron's
                    government passed bills to ease the cost-of-living crisis,[272] to repeal the
                    COVID-era "state of health emergency",[273] and to revive the French nuclear
                    energy sector.[274] However, government proposals were defeated several times in
                    the National Assembly[275] and by the end of 2022, the Borne cabinet had had to
                    use the provisions of Article 49.3 of the Constitution ten times in a row to
                    pass the 2023 Government Budget and Social Security Budget.[276] In March 2023,
                    Macron's government passed a law raising the retirement age from 62 to 64,
                    partly bypassing Parliament by again resorting to Article 49.3 to break the
                    parliamentary deadlock.[277] Nationwide protests that had begun when the bill
                    was introduced back in January increased in intensity after the reform was
                    passed without a solemn vote.[citation needed][clarification needed] On 20 March
                    2023, Macron's cabinet, headed by Prime minister Borne, survived a cross-party
                    motion of no-confidence by only nine votes, the slimmest margin for such a vote
                    since 1992.[278] On 12 June 2023, his government survived its 17th no-confidence
                    motion since the beginning of the 16th legislature; the motion, brought by the
                    left-wing NUPES coalition, fell 50 votes short of the 289 votes needed.[279] In
                    early summer 2023, French authorities faced riots following the killing of Nahel
                    M., aged 17, by a police officer during a traffic stop.[280][281] To calm
                    widespread unrest, comparable in intensity to the 2005 French riots[citation
                    needed], Macron's administration ramped up government response, with a total of
                    45,000 police officers deployed on the ground and a ministerial order advising
                    courts to apply harsher sentences and accelerated procedures:[282] this
                    crackdown resulted in over 1,300 arrests on the fourth night of unrest alone,
                    bringing the total number of arrests since the riots' beginning to over 2,000 as
                    of 1 July.[283] On 20 July 2023, Macron carried out a government reshuffle at
                    the end of the "hundred days of appeasement and action" he called for in April
                    2023 following the violent protests surrounding the passage of his pension
                    system reform. Pap Ndiaye and Marlène Schiappa were sacked as part of the
                    reshuffle.[284] On 1 August 2023, Macron signed into law a multi-year military
                    planning bill, which set the stage for a 40%-increase in military spending to a
                    total of €413 billion between 2024 and 2030, after it was passed by the French
                    parliament on 13 July 2023.[285][286] In February 2023, Macron's government
                    introduced an immigration and asylum bill aimed at removing deportation
                    safeguards, fast-tracking asylum application process and immigration litigation,
                    while also facilitating legalization of undocumented workers.[287] His
                    government later pulled the draft legislation amid fears of defeat in
                    Parliament, instead planning to hold talks with the centre-right LR party before
                    reintroducing the bill in the autumn.[288] In August 2023, in a lengthy
                    interview with weekly magazine Le Point, Macron said that France "must
                    significantly reduce immigration, starting with illegal immigration" because the
                    "current situation is not sustainable".[289] </groupText>

                <groupText>On 11 December 2023, the "flagship" immigration bill introduced by
                    Macron's government was unexpectedly defeated after the narrow passage of a
                    motion for preliminary dismissal in the National Assembly.[290] Political
                    commentators and news media described the vote as a "spectacular debacle",
                    eventually sparking a major political crisis for Macron's minority
                    administration.[291] In an effort to salvage the bill, Macron's government sent
                    the draft legislation to a joint parliamentary committee: it resulted in a deal
                    with the conservative-controlled Senate on a drastically hardened bill. On 19
                    December 2023, the French Parliament passed the piece of legislation thanks to
                    support from the conservative LR and far-right RN parliamentary groups and in
                    spite of a major rebellion from Macron's own coalition and ministers.[292]
                    Health Minister Aurélien Rousseau, whom Macron had appointed to the government
                    only 6 months earlier, resigned shortly after the vote.[293] On the 65th
                    anniversary of the French Constitution on 4 October 2023, Macron unveiled
                    avenues for constitutional reform: broadening the scope and relaxing rules for
                    referenda; enshrining the right to abortion and climate protection in the
                    Constitution; stepping up the level of territorial devolution; giving some form
                    of political autonomy to Corsica and New Caledonia.[294] On 4 March 2024, a
                    joint session of the French Parliament passed a Macron-sponsored constitutional
                    amendment to protect abortion as a 'guaranteed freedom' in the
                    Constitution.[295] It represented the first constitutional reform since 2008 and
                    the first since Macron took office in 2017. In January 2024, in the wake of the
                    government crisis produced by the passage of the 'controversial' immigration
                    bill, Macron requested Prime minister Élisabeth Borne to resign and subsequently
                    replaced her by Education minister Gabriel Attal, making him both the youngest
                    head of government in French history and the first openly gay man ever to hold
                    the job.[296] The new Attal cabinet was widely described as the most
                    right-leaning government since the start of the Macron Presidency: out of the 14
                    Cabinet ministers appointed on 11 January 2024 by Macron and Attal, 57% are
                    former members of the conservative UMP/LR party, while prominent left-leaning
                    ministers of the outgoing Borne government were sacked, moves described as
                    indicating a notable tilt to the right.[297][298] In February 2024, amid slowing
                    economic growth and disappointing unemployment figures, Macron's government
                    unveiled €10 billion in emergency spending cuts to hold to its 2024 deficit
                    goal.[299] A month later, Macron convened a 'crisis meeting' to discuss the
                    state of France's public finances amid reports showing that the government had
                    heavily missed its 2023 fiscal targets, with a bigger-than-forecasted deficit,
                    putting the country's credit rating at risk of downgrade.[300] On 16 June 2022,
                    Macron visited Ukraine alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italy's Prime
                    Minister Mario Draghi. He met with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and
                    expressed "European Unity" for Ukraine.[301][302] He said that the nations that
                    remained neutral in the Russo-Ukrainian War made a historic mistake and were
                    complicit in the new imperialism.[303] In September 2022, Macron criticized the
                    United States, Norway and other "friendly" natural gas supplier states for the
                    extremely high prices of their supplies,[304] saying in October 2022 that
                    Europeans are "paying four times more than the price you sell to your industry.
                    That is not exactly the meaning of friendship."[305] Macron and his wife
                    attended the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II in Westminster Abbey, London,
                    on 19 September 2022, and the coronation of King Charles III the following
                    year.[306][307] On 23 October 2022, Macron became the first foreign leader to
                    meet new Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, just a day after she and her
                    ministers were sworn into office.[308] During a summit to China with European
                    Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, which included a formal meeting with
                    Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and President
                    of China, Macron called for Europe to reduce its dependence on the United States
                    in general and to stay neutral and avoid being drawn into any possible
                    confrontation between the U.S. and China over Taiwan. Speaking after a three-day
                    state visit to China, Macron emphasised his theory of strategic autonomy,
                    suggesting that Europe could become a "third superpower". He argued that Europe
                    should focus on boosting its own defence industries and additionally reduce its
                    dependence on the United States dollar (USD).[309] in a follow-up speech in The
                    Hague to further outline his vision of strategic autonomy for Europe.[310] On 7
                    June 2023, a report by the pan-European think tank European Council on Foreign
                    Relations (ECFR) found that most Europeans agree with Macron's views on China
                    and the United States.[311] In February 2023, he welcomed Ethiopian Prime
                    Minister Abiy Ahmed in Paris to normalize relations between France and Ethiopia,
                    strained by the Tigray War between the Ethiopian government and Tigray
                    rebels.[312] On 31 May 2023 Macron visited the GLOBSEC forum in Bratislava,
                    where he again delivered a speech on European sovereignty.[313] During the
                    question and answer session that followed the Bratislava speech,[314] he said
                    that negotiating with Putin may have to take priority over any war crimes
                    tribunal which some others, including Zelensky, wish to see.[315] On 12 June
                    2023, Macron promised to deliver more ammunition, weapons and armed vehicles to
                    help Ukrainian forces with the ongoing counter-offensive to liberate
                    Russian-occupied southeastern Ukraine.[316] At the NATO Summit in Vilnius, he
                    promised to supply Ukraine with Scalp long-range cruise missiles to hit Russian
                    targets deep behind the front lines.[317] On 10 November 2023, he said that what
                    Russia is doing in Ukraine is "imperialism and colonialism" and it was the
                    "duty" of France and other countries to help Ukraine defend itself, but added
                    that maybe the time will come to hold fair peace negotiations and find a
                    solution with Russia.[318] In June 2023 Macron hosted a global climate finance
                    conference described by many as the new Bretton Woods Conference. The purpose is
                    to adjust the global economy to the contemporary threats of climate change and
                    hunger. One of the proposition is to offer to low income countries help instead
                    of credits so they can use their resource for stopping climate change and
                    poverty instead of debt payments. Macron supported the idea, but a climate
                    activist from Uganda remarked that the promises were meaningless if at the same
                    time Macron supported projects like the East African Crude Oil Pipeline, a major
                    threat to the climate and to the drinking water of 40 million people.[319] At
                    the summit Macron proposed an international taxation system and debt
                    restructuring but stressed it can have an effect only with international
                    cooperation.[320] In July 2023, Macron postponed his planned state visit to
                    Germany due to the ongoing Nahel M. riots.[321] In October 2023, Macron
                    condemned Hamas' actions during the Israel–Hamas war and expressed his support
                    to Israel and its right to self-defense.[322][323] He criticized Iran for its
                    support of Hamas.[324] On 24 October, Macron visited Israel to express
                    solidarity with the country. He said that the anti-ISIL coalition should also
                    fight against Hamas.[325] On 10 November 2023, he called for a ceasefire and
                    urged Israel to stop bombing Gaza and killing civilians.[326] In January 2024,
                    he accused Hamas of using Palestinian civilians as human shields and said Israel
                    had the right to defend itself.[327] In February 2024, during a meeting with
                    other European states, Macron generated controversy by suggesting sending ground
                    troops to Ukraine.[328] In March 2024, Macron defended the Comprehensive
                    Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between Canada and the EU, branding the
                    agreement as a "very good deal", after the French Senate voted against its
                    ratification.[329] In March 2024 Macron and the Brazilian president Luiz Inácio
                    Lula da Silva agreed about cooperation between Brazil and France on different
                    environmental issues, including the transmission of 1.1 billion dollars for
                    preserving the Amazon rainforest.[330] On 10 July 2022, The Guardian revealed
                    that Macron had assisted Uber in lobbying during his term as the Minister of
                    Economics and Industry,[331] leading to calls from opposition lawmakers for a
                    parliamentary inquiry.[332][333] In his own defence, Macron expressed that he
                    "did his job" and that he would "do it again tomorrow and the day after
                    tomorrow".[333] He stated, "I'm proud of it".[333] As president of France,
                    Macron also serves ex officio as one of the two co-princes of Andorra. His chief
                    of staff Patrick Strzoda serves as his representative in this capacity. Joan
                    Enric Vives i Sicília, appointed as the current Bishop of Urgell on 12 May 2003,
                    serves as Macron's co-prince. Macron swore the Constitution of Andorra through
                    Strzoda in an act that took place on 15 June 2017 in Casa de la Vall.[334]
                    During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Andorran government asked France for economic
                    aid, but Macron refused, arguing that the Bank of France could not offer loans
                    to another country without the approval of the European Central Bank.[335]

                <groupText>Macron is married to Brigitte Trogneux,[336] 24 years his senior,[337]
                    and his former La Providence high school teacher in Amiens.[338][339] They met
                    during a theatre workshop that she was giving when he was a 15-year-old student
                    and she was a 39-year-old teacher.[340][341] His parents initially attempted to
                    separate the couple by sending him away to Paris to finish the final year of his
                    schooling, as they felt his youth made this relationship inappropriate.[14][341]
                    The couple reunited after Macron graduated, and were married in 2007.[341] She
                    has three children from a previous marriage; he has no children of his
                    own.[342][unreliable source?] Trogneux's role in Macron's 2017 presidential
                    campaign has been considered pivotal, with close Macron allies stating that
                    Trogneux helped Macron to develop skills like public speaking.[343] His best man
                    was Henry Hermand (1924–2016), a businessman who loaned €550,000 to Macron for
                    the purchase of his first apartment in Paris when he was Inspector of Finances.
                    Hermand also let Macron use some of his offices on the Avenue des Champs Élysées
                    in Paris for his movement En Marche.[344][345] In the 2002 French presidential
                    election, Macron voted for souverainist Jean-Pierre Chevènement.[346] In 2007,
                    Macron voted for Ségolène Royal in the second round of the presidential
                    election.[347] During the Socialist Party primary in 2011, Macron voiced his
                    support for François Hollande.[348] Macron plays the piano,[349] and studied
                    piano for ten years in his youth.[15] He especially enjoys the work of Robert
                    Schumann and Franz Liszt.[350][351] Macron also skis,[352] plays tennis[353] and
                    enjoys boxing.[354] In addition to his native French, Macron speaks fluent
                    English.[355][356] In August 2017, a photojournalist was arrested and detained
                    by the police for six hours after he entered the private residence where Macron
                    was vacationing in Marseille.[357] Macron subsequently filed a complaint for
                    "harassment".[357] In September 2017, he dropped the complaint "as a gesture of
                    appeasement".[358] On 27 August 2017, Macron and his wife Brigitte adopted Nemo,
                    a black Labrador Retriever-Griffon dog who lives with them in the Élysée
                    Palace.[359] As a schoolboy, Macron decided to be baptized as a Catholic. In
                    June 2018, prior to meeting Pope Francis, he identified himself as an agnostic
                    Catholic.[360][361] In the same year he agreed to become an honorary canon of St
                    John Lateran, the cathedral of Rome.[361] A fan of football, Macron is a
                    supporter of French club Olympique de Marseille.[362] During the 2018 World Cup,
                    he attended the semi-final between France and Belgium with the Belgian King
                    Philippe and Queen Mathilde,[363] and at the World Cup final against Croatia, he
                    sat and celebrated alongside Croatian president Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović. Macron
                    received widespread media attention for his celebrations and his interactions
                    with the Croatian president.[364][365][366][367][368] On 17 December 2020,
                    Macron tested positive for COVID-19[369] leading to the cancellation of his
                    scheduled trips for the following month, including a visit to Lebanon.[370]

            <modelAnswer>The RDF statement cannot be inferred from the given snippet.The snippet
                provides a detailed biography and political background of Emmanuel Macron, including
                his tenure as President of France, his ministerial roles, his education, career in
                finance, and his political activities. However, the snippet does not mention any
                award or honor received by Emmanuel Macron, particularly the "Grand Cross of the
                National Order of the Lion."The "Grand Cross of the National Order of the Lion" is a
                specific award that—if received—would typically be mentioned in comprehensive
                biographies or profiles of a person, especially if the award is relevant to the
                individual's recognitions or honors.Since the snippet does not include any
                information about Emmanuel Macron having received the "Grand Cross of the National
                Order of the Lion," we cannot infer the RDF statement from the provided information.
                It is important to look for explicit mentions of awards or honors to confirm their
                receipt, and in this case, such an explicit mention is absent.</modelAnswer>

            <modelAnswer>No, the given RDF statement cannot be inferred from the snippet
                provided.The RDF statement asserts that "Emmanuel Macron" received the "Grand Cross

                does not contain any information regarding Emmanuel Macron receiving this award or
                any award at all. The snippet primarily focuses on Macron's political career, his
                legislative initiatives, his resignation from the government, his founding of En
                Marche, and various positions he held or was offered.Therefore, without evidence in
                the text to support the RDF statement, we cannot infer that Emmanuel Macron received

                RDF statement ["Emmanuel Macron" - "award received" - "Grand Cross of the National

                or honors received by Macron, including the "Grand Cross of the National Order of

                strategies, and election results, but does not report any details regarding Macron
                receiving any decorations or honors.Therefore, with the data provided in this

                completed high school and the undergraduate program with a "Bac S, Mention Très

                provides extensive information regarding Emmanuel Macron’s political activities,

                various legislative matters, his stances on international conflicts, environmental
                issues, economic strategies, and other aspects of his presidency and previous roles.
                There is also a mention of his history with Andorra as co-prince and his actions
                during the COVID-19 pandemic.However, nowhere in the snippet is there any mention of
                Emmanuel Macron receiving the "Concours général" award. Therefore, without this

            <modelAnswer>The RDF statement cannot be inferred from the given snippet.Reasoning:- The
                snippet states that Emmanuel Macron was a member of the Socialist Party from 2006 to
                2009.- However, it also mentions that he later founded and was a part of En Marche,
                which is described as "a centrist and pro-European political movement."- The name
                "En Marche" evolves to "Renaissance," which is stated as a centrist political party
                that Macron is a founding member of.- It is also specified that his party, renamed
                "La République En Marche! (LREM)," gained a majority in the National Assembly.From
                the above points, there is no evidence in the snippet to suggest Macron is or has
                declared himself to be an "independent politician." Instead, he is associated with
                multiple political parties, specifically the Socialist Party and later La République
                En Marche, which contradicts the RDF statement that labels him as an independent

            <modelAnswer>The RDF statement cannot be inferred from the given snippet.Reasoning:The
                snippet explicitly states, "In August 2015, Macron said that he was no longer a
                member of the Socialist Party and was an independent."[51] This sentence indicates
                that Emmanuel Macron identified himself as an independent politician, which supports
                the RDF statement given ("Emmanuel Macron" - "member of political party" -
                "independent politician").However, the RDF is considering "independent politician"
                as a political party membership, which is incorrect. Being an independent politician
                means that the person is not a member of any political party. Therefore, while the
                snippet does say Macron was an independent, this should not be deduced as him being
                a member of an "independent political party," as the concept of being an independent
                directly contradicts party membership.Thus, the correct RDF representation of the
                information provided would be simply that Emmanuel Macron is an independent
                politician, not associated with any particular political party at the time stated in
                the snippet.</modelAnswer>

            <modelAnswer>Based on the information provided in the snippet, we cannot infer that
                Emmanuel Macron is a "member of political party" - "independent politician". In
                fact, the snippet provides information that contradicts this RDF statement:1. Macron
                accumulated a wide array of supporters [...] securing endorsements from François
                Bayrou of the Democratic Movement (MoDem) [...].2. Macron's party La République En
                Marche and its Democratic Movement allies secured a comfortable majority, winning
                350 seats out of 577.These points indicate that Emmanuel Macron is associated with a
                political party, La République En Marche, which he founded, and is not an
                independent politician. Moreover, his alliance with the Democratic Movement and
                endorsements from various political figures suggest that he is very much within the
                political party system rather than operating outside of it as an
                independent.Therefore, the RDF statement cannot be inferred based on the information

            <modelAnswer>The given RDF statement cannot be inferred from the provided snippet. The
                RDF statement asserts that Emmanuel Macron is a "member of political party" that is
                an "independent politician." However, the provided text snippet does not contain any
                direct information about Emmanuel Macron's political party membership or status as
                an independent politician.In order to infer the RDF statement from the snippet,
                there would need to be a mention of Macron's affiliation with a political party or
                an explicit statement about him being an independent politician. Since such
                information is absent from the snippet, we cannot draw the conclusion that the RDF
                statement is accurate based on the provided text.As additional context (outside the
                provided snippet), it is worth noting that Emmanuel Macron founded his own centrist
                political movement called "La République En Marche!" (LREM or REM) in 2016, and he
                is not generally described as an independent politician since the founding of his
                party. Prior to that, he had been appointed as Minister of the Economy, Industry,
                and Digital Affairs in 2014 under a Socialist Party government in France, although
                he was not a member of the Socialist Party.Based on these circumstances and the
                content of the snippet, we cannot infer the RDF statement "Emmanuel Macron" -
                "member of political party" - "independent politician" to be true.</modelAnswer>

            <modelAnswer>No, the RDF statement ["Emmanuel Macron" - "member of political party" -
                "independent politician"] cannot be inferred from the given snippet. Reasoning: The
                snippet does not provide any information regarding Emmanuel Macron's affiliation
                with any political party or his status as an independent politician. There is no
                mention of his membership in a political party or any indication of him being an
                independent politician. Furthermore, without explicit information about Macron's
                political party status at the time referred to in the snippet, we cannot assume or
                infer his status as an independent politician.To make such an inference, we would
                need information that directly states Emmanuel Macron's political party membership
                or lack thereof. Since that information is not provided in the snippet, the RDF

            <modelAnswer>No, the given RDF statement ["Emmanuel Macron" - "member of political

                the snippet does not mention Emmanuel Macron's membership in any political party or
                his status as an independent politician. The RDF statement would suggest that
                Emmanuel Macron is not affiliated with any political party, labeling him as an
                "independent politician." However, the snippet does not provide any information
                regarding his political party affiliations. It mainly discusses political actions,
                international relations, and other government-related activities during Macron's
                presidency, but does not address his party membership. Therefore, we cannot confirm
                Macron's status as an independent politician without additional information
                specifying his political party membership or lack thereof.</modelAnswer>

            <modelAnswer>The RDF statement cannot be inferred from the given snippet.Reasoning:The
                information provided in the snippet does not mention Emmanuel Macron's current
                political party affiliation or mention him explicitly as an "independent
                politician." The snippet does include some hints about Macron's political leanings
                and past actions in politics, such as voting for various candidates from different
                parties and supporting François Hollande during the Socialist Party primary.
                However, this information does not directly confirm whether he is currently an
                independent politician or a member of a political party.To confirm Macron's
                political party membership or his status as an independent politician, information
                explicitly stating his current political affiliation would be required. Since the

            <modelAnswer>No, the given RDF statement cannot be inferred from the given snippet.The
                RDF statement provided is:["Emmanuel Macron" - "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"]This RDF
                statement implies a relationship where "Emmanuel Macron" has a spouse named
                "Brigitte Macron."Upon reviewing the provided snippet, there is a mention of a
                relationship between Emmanuel Macron and a person named Brigitte Auzière, as
                follows:"His parents sent him to Paris due to their alarm at the bond he had formed
                with Brigitte Auzière, a married teacher with three children at Jésuites de la
                Providence, who later became his wife."This constitutes evidence of a marital
                relationship between Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Auzière, who is known to be
                Brigitte Macron. Therefore, though the exact name "Brigitte Macron" is not used in
                the snippet, the context provides enough information to infer that Brigitte Auzière
                is indeed the person who became Emmanuel Macron's spouse. Her marriage to Emmanuel
                Macron is confirmed by the phrase "who later became his wife," which aligns with the
                RDF statement.Thus, despite the initial statement that no inference can be made, the
                conclusion after an in-depth review of the snippet is that the RDF statement can
                actually be inferred given that Brigitte Auzière is the same person as Brigitte
                Macron. The reasoning is based on the connection established in the text, which
                indicates the marital relationship between Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte
                Auzière/Macron.</modelAnswer>

                        is the President referred to, and that Brigitte Macron is his spouse.
                        Neither of those facts is provided in the snippet. Therefore, the

                        Jean-Marie Le Pen in 2002. However, in the 2022 legislative election, his

                                        relationship details, so we cannot infer the RDF statement

                                        mainly focuses on Emmanuel Macron's political orientation,
                                        his professional qualities observed during his time at the
                                        Élysée, his role as a secretary-general adjoint, and the
                                        trust he has from the president. It discusses Macron's
                                        political career and some endorsements from his peers and

                                        personal relationships or his spouse. Therefore, one cannot
                                        deduce from this snippet that Brigitte Macron is the spouse

                                        individual named Brigitte Macron. Therefore, based on this

                                        up in the northern town of Amiens but his parents sent him
                                        away to Paris to finish high school in an attempt to break
                                        up his relationship with his school French teacher, Brigitte
                                        Trogneux, 20 years his senior. Macron and Trogneux stayed
                                        together and have now been married for nine

                                    <modelAnswer>Yes, the given RDF statement can be inferred from
                                        the given snippet. Reasoning: - The snippet provides
                                        information that Macron's marriage has been a subject of
                                        interest, indicating that he is married. - It mentions his
                                        relationship with his school French teacher, "Brigitte
                                        Trogneux," and states that "Macron and Trogneux stayed
                                        together and have now been married for nine years." This
                                        information confirms that "Emmanuel Macron" is married to
                                        "Brigitte Trogneux," who is known as "Brigitte Macron" after
                                        marriage. Therefore, the RDF relation ["Emmanuel Macron" -
                                        "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"] can be inferred from the text. </modelAnswer>

                                        Amiens. On the big-skied plains of the Somme, amid the woods
                                        and the fields of yellow rape that cover former bloody

                                        13th-century cathedral, and charmless rebuilt central drag,
                                        Amiens is arresting both for its splendour and its banality.
                                        It is the place that shaped Mr Macron, and the town he fled.
                                        It was also the setting for a fraught encounter in the

                                        at the factory that afternoon. It was a brave decision. As

                period, his eventual victory in the presidential elections, and political actions
                following his election. Therefore, there's nothing in the text that allows us to

                that Emmanuel Macron is married to Brigitte, and "The couple reunited after Macron
                graduated, and were married in 2007," which confirms that the marriage took place.
                Additionally, it is common knowledge that when a woman marries, she may take her
                husband's surname. Although the snippet does not explicitly state that Brigitte took
                the surname "Macron," it is implied by the context and common practice. Therefore,

                        when he was a 15-year-old student and she was a 39-year-old
                        teacher.[340][341] His parents initially attempted to separate the couple by
                        sending him away to Paris to finish the final year of his schooling, as they
                        felt his youth made this relationship inappropriate.[14][341] The couple
                        reunited after Macron graduated, and were married in 2007.[341] She has
                        three children from a previous marriage; he has no children of his

                        campaign has been considered pivotal, with close Macron allies stating that
                        Trogneux helped Macron to develop skills like public

                        information directly supports the inference that Brigitte Trogneux is the
                        spouse of Emmanuel Macron. Since the standard practice is to refer to women
                        by their married name, especially in the context of a relationship, and
                        given that Emmanuel Macron is widely known to be married to Brigitte Macron,
                        it is reasonable to infer that Brigitte Trogneux took the surname Macron
                        upon marriage. Therefore, Brigitte Trogneux and Brigitte Macron are the same

                                    <modelAnswer>Yes, the given RDF statement ["Emmanuel Macron" -
                                        "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"] can be inferred from the given
                                        snippet. The snippet provides the necessary information to
                                        make this inference. It mentions Emmanuel Macron as an
                                        "upstart presidential candidate" and refers to Brigitte
                                        Trogneux as "now his close adviser and wife." This confirms
                                        that Brigitte Trogneux is the spouse of Emmanuel Macron.
                                        Knowing that Brigitte Trogneux married Emmanuel Macron and
                                        that married women often (but not always) adopt their
                                        husband's surname, we can infer that her current name would

                                        is later referred to with her married name, Auzière. This

                                        spouse is mentioned for him, it can be inferred that Ms.

                                        widespread public knowledge confirms that Brigitte Trogneux
                                        is the married name of Brigitte Macron, indicating the two

                                        got married. The RDF statement asserts that Emmanuel Macron
                                        is the spouse of Brigitte Macron, and while the snippet
                                        suggests a close relationship and a promise of marriage, it
                                        does not confirm that the marriage took place. Therefore,

                                        "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"] can be inferred from the given
                                        snippet. Reasoning: In the snippet, "At their 2007 wedding"
                                        indicates that a wedding took place. Mr. Macron's reference
                                        to "Ms. Trogneux’s children" suggests that this is the name
                                        of the woman he married. Although the snippet does not
                                        directly state "Brigitte Macron," it is known that Brigitte
                                        Macron's maiden name is Trogneux. In the context of a
                                        wedding and referencing Ms. Trogneux's children, it implies
                                        that Mr. Macron is her husband. Thus, we can infer that they
                                        are married, or in other words, Emmanuel Macron is the
                                        spouse of Brigitte Macron. </modelAnswer>

                                        "flaunting his personal life to win votes," it does not
                                        specifically identify Ms. Trogneux as "Brigitte Macron" or
                                        as the "spouse" of Emmanuel Macron. The text also does not

                                        Emmanuel Macron, nor does it explicitly state her
                                        relationship to him. The snippet does imply a close and

                                        Mr. Macron has a spouse. However, without additional context
                                        or explicit information about who his spouse is, and the

                                        - "Brigitte Macron"] cannot be inferred from the given
                                        snippet. Reasoning: The provided snippet discusses the
                                        political situation regarding the Cabinet Valls II, the
                                        Socialist Party, and the possibility of early elections. It
                                        makes a brief mention of a "former Rothschild banker within
                                        a Socialist government," which is likely a reference to
                                        Emmanuel Macron's past career before he entered politics.
                                        However, the snippet does not mention anything about
                                        Emmanuel Macron's personal life or relationships.
                                        Specifically, there is no mention of his spouse or marriage.
                                        Therefore, information about his spouse, Brigitte Macron,
                                        cannot be inferred from the text given. The RDF statement
                                        concerns his personal life, which is not addressed in the

                                        Macron: He is said to have always been attracted by people
                                        older, more mature than him. He is said to have been a pal
                                        of his professors rather than his fellow students. He fell

                                        given snippet. The snippet indicates that "Emmanuel Macron
                                        married Brigitte Trogneux," which directly supports the RDF
                                        triple ["Emmanuel Macron" - "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"].
                                        The snippet not only mentions that Emmanuel Macron married
                                        Brigitte Trogneux but also provides additional context about
                                        her being his French language professor and belonging to a
                                        family associated with chocolate production. The RDF
                                        statement represents the relationship between Emmanuel
                                        Macron and Brigitte Trogneux as spouses, which is consistent
                                        with the information in the snippet that they got married in
                                        2007. Therefore, the RDF accurately reflects the information
                                        conveyed in the text. </modelAnswer>

                                    <modelAnswer>No, the given RDF statement cannot be inferred from
                                        the given snippet. Reasoning: The snippet talks about

                                        presidential election, and it mentions Emmanuel Macron.
                                        However, it does not mention his spouse or any personal
                                        relationships. The RDF statement ["Emmanuel Macron" -
                                        "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"] is a statement that relates

                                        and those in the Socialist party, pointing to Emmanuel

                                        Therefore, the RDF statement about Macron's spouse being

                                        which the government, due to its lack of support, had to
                                        force through by decree. The law aimed to boost economic
                                        growth by, among other things, allowing employers to more

                                        subsequently clarifies with "Brigitte Trogneux." 2. Emmanuel
                                        Macron refers to "Brigitte" as his wife within the quote. 3.
                                        The snippet later describes "Brigitte Trogneux" as "Macron’s

                                        "Brigitte Trogneux." 4. There is no indication in the
                                        snippet that the marital status has changed or that Brigitte
                                        is not currently his spouse, so we can infer that the
                                        referenced "Brigitte" is still his wife, Brigitte Macron. 5.
                                        From these connections, it can be safely inferred that
                                        Emmanuel Macron's spouse is Brigitte Macron (née Trogneux).

                                    <modelAnswer>Yes, the RDF statement ["Emmanuel Macron" -
                                        "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"] can be inferred from the given
                                        snippet. Reasoning: The snippet includes a reference to
                                        "Brigitte Macron" and refers to "son mari Emmanuel Macron,"
                                        which translates from French to "her husband Emmanuel
                                        Macron." The use of "son mari" explicitly identifies
                                        Brigitte Macron as the wife of Emmanuel Macron. In the
                                        context of the RDF statement, the "spouse" relationship is
                                        bidirectional and gender-neutral. Therefore, if Emmanuel
                                        Macron is the husband of Brigitte Macron, it is equally
                                        valid to say Brigitte Macron is the spouse of Emmanuel
                                        Macron; hence, the RDF statement is correct based on the
                                        information provided in the snippet. </modelAnswer>

                                        "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"] can be inferred from the given
                                        snippet. Reasoning: - The snippet reveals that Emmanuel
                                        Macron has been sharing his life with a woman for about
                                        twenty years, indicating a longstanding relationship. - It
                                        is mentioned that Brigitte is Emmanuel's former French
                                        teacher and that the age difference between them is
                                        significant. - The use of possessive phrases like "son mari"
                                        (her husband) makes it evident that Brigitte is Macron's
                                        wife. - Given the common knowledge that in a formal and
                                        serious context (like a political figure's biography), when
                                        a couple is described as sharing their lives together along
                                        with other familial details, it typically implies they are
                                        married. Therefore, considering the description of the
                                        relationship's duration, depth, and portrayal, it is
                                        reasonable to conclude that the woman referred to in the
                                        snippet is Emmanuel Macron's spouse, and since her name is
                                        given as Brigitte Macron, we can infer the RDF statement is
                                        true. </modelAnswer>

                                        discusses statements and perspectives of Brigitte Macron, at
                                        no point does it explicitly mention that she is the spouse
                                        of Emmanuel Macron. The snippet's focus is on her sentiments
                                        about the age difference reactions and the media's interest
                                        in her age, without direct reference to her marital status
                                        or relationship to Emmanuel Macron. Therefore, based solely

                                        Brigitte Macron's relationship with Emmanuel Macron.

                                        quoted statement indicates a close personal relationship by
                                        discussing a political strategy with someone referred to as
                                        Emmanuel Macron. The use of the phrase "son problème ce sera
                                        ma gueule" implies possession which, in the context of a
                                        married couple, would make sense. Additionally, the term
                                        "couple Macron" directly refers to Emmanuel and Brigitte
                                        Macron as a pair, which in everyday language implies a
                                        marital relationship. Therefore, it can be inferred that
                                        Brigitte Macron is the spouse of Emmanuel Macron, and the

                                        the snippet. The RDF statement in question is a structured
                                        representation of a relationship, indicating that "Emmanuel
                                        Macron" is the spouse of "Brigitte Macron." In the snippet,
                                        there are several references that allow us to infer this
                                        relationship: 1. The use of "première dame" (First Lady) in
                                        reference to Brigitte Macron, a term which is commonly used
                                        to describe the wife of the President in the French
                                        Republic. 2. Brigitte Macron is described as being part of
                                        "un couple atypique" (an atypical couple) and mentions a
                                        "vingt-quatre ans d'écart" (twenty-four years difference)
                                        which suggests a spousal relationship with a significant age
                                        difference. 3. The snippet contains personal information
                                        about Brigitte Macron regarding how she felt about the
                                        campaign and her views on her age, indicating close
                                        proximity to the events described─that is, the type of
                                        proximity that would be typical of a spouse. Given these
                                        points, the snippet provides sufficient context to
                                        confidently infer that Brigitte Macron is the spouse of

                                    <modelAnswer>Yes, the given RDF statement can be inferred from
                                        the given snippet. The snippet mentions "beau-père" which
                                        translates from French to English as "father-in-law" or
                                        "stepfather." This term indicates that Emmanuel Macron is
                                        the stepfather to Brigitte Macron's children: Sébastien,
                                        Laurence, and Tiphaine Auzière. The usage of "beau-père"
                                        implies a marital relationship between Emmanuel Macron and
                                        Brigitte Macron, as it is a title given to the husband of
                                        one's mother. As such, Emmanuel Macron is married to
                                        Brigitte Macron, who is thus his spouse. Therefore, the RDF

                                        implicitly indicates their marital status through the
                                        reference of Emmanuel Macron as the "beau-père" of
                                        Brigitte's children. </modelAnswer>

                                        une telle relation a pu se nouer entre une prof mariée et
                                        son élève, de 24 ans son cadet ? L'idylle est avant tout
                                        présentée comme celle de "deux intellos" qui se sont

                                    <modelAnswer>Yes, the given RDF statement can be inferred from
                                        the given snippet. Reasoning: The snippet discusses the
                                        relationship between Brigitte and Emmanuel Macron,
                                        mentioning that Brigitte was a married teacher (prof mariée)
                                        and Emmanuel, her student, was 24 years her junior. It
                                        explains that their relationship started when Emmanuel was a
                                        student and Brigitte Trogneux (also known as Auzière at the
                                        time) was his French teacher. The snippet highlights that
                                        despite their unusual beginnings, they have an intellectual
                                        connection and have remained together ever since, implying a
                                        long-term, committed relationship. Given the context and the
                                        information provided, it is reasonable to conclude that
                                        Brigitte and Emmanuel Macron are married to each other,
                                        making Brigitte Macron the spouse of Emmanuel Macron. In the
                                        RDF: ["Emmanuel Macron" - "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"], the
                                        term "spouse" refers to a partner in a marriage. Since the
                                        snippet discusses the longstanding union between Brigitte
                                        and Emmanuel Macron that began with her as his teacher and
                                        evolved into an enduring romantic relationship, we can infer
                                        that they are indeed married to each other, fulfilling the
                                        'spouse' relationship specified in the RDF statement. </modelAnswer>

                                        The phrase "spouse" implies a marital relationship. However,

                                        It merely illustrates the initial stages of their

                                        Brigitte's memories and perceptions of him as a "little
                                        genius" and a talented individual in a play. The name

                                    <modelAnswer>Yes, the given RDF statement can be inferred from
                                        the given snippet. Reasoning: The snippet refers to Brigitte
                                        Trogneux as "l'épouse de l'ex-ministre," indicating that she
                                        is the wife of a former minister. Additionally, it later
                                        mentions, "Brigitte Auzières et Emmanuel Macron resteront
                                        inséparables," suggesting that a person named Brigitte
                                        Auzières and Emmanuel Macron have a close and inseparable
                                        relationship. The context implies that Brigitte Trogneux,
                                        also referred to as Brigitte Auzières here (Trogneux being
                                        her maiden name and Auzières likely her first married name),
                                        is married to Emmanuel Macron. Therefore, the RDF statement
                                        ["Emmanuel Macron" - "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"] can be
                                        considered true based on the information provided in the
                                        snippet. It's common knowledge that Brigitte Macron was
                                        known by the surnames Trogneux and Auzières before marrying
                                        Emmanuel Macron, and the snippet confirms that she is the
                                        spouse of Emmanuel Macron. </modelAnswer>

                                        2015, les parents d'Emmanuel Macron, âgé de 16 ans en 1993,
                                        étaient contre cette relation qu'ils imaginaient néfaste
                                        pour leur fils. Les deux médecins ont alors décidé de
                                        l'éloigner d'Amiens et de l'envoyer finir sa scolarité à
                                        Paris. Emmanuel Macron a tout de même pu compter sur le
                                        soutien de Germaine, sa grand-mère, ancienne principale de
                                        collège. C'est elle qui l'aidera à trouver un logement dans

                                        Paris, en terminale.</paragraphText>
                                    <modelAnswer>No, the given RDF statement cannot be definitively
                                        inferred from the snippet provided. The snippet talks about
                                        Emmanuel Macron's relationship with his French teacher and
                                        the opposition he faced from his parents regarding this
                                        relationship. It also mentions that he was supported by his
                                        grandmother, Germaine, who helped him find housing in Paris.
                                        However, the snippet does not explicitly mention the name of
                                        the French teacher nor does it state that Emmanuel Macron
                                        eventually married her. The RDF statement requires the
                                        specific information that Emmanuel Macron's spouse is
                                        Brigitte Macron, which is not present in the text provided.
                                        Therefore, based on the information given in the snippet,
                                        one cannot infer that Emmanuel Macron's spouse is Brigitte
                                        Macron. Additional information confirming their marriage
                                        would be needed to validate the RDF statement. </modelAnswer>

                                        Emmanuel Macron de retrouver Brigitte Trogneux, bien qu'il

                                    <modelAnswer>Yes, the given RDF statement ["Emmanuel Macron" -
                                        "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"] can be inferred from the given
                                        snippet. Reasoning: 1. The snippet mentions a romantic
                                        relationship between the young man and "la femme de sa vie"
                                        (the woman of his life). While it doesn't mention marriage
                                        directly with these words, it implies a deep commitment when
                                        it states, "je vous épouserai" (I will marry you). 2. The
                                        text states that "Brigitte Auzière a divorcé et est
                                        redevenue Trogneux" (Brigitte Auzière got divorced and
                                        became Trogneux again). This implies that Brigitte Auzière
                                        was married, got divorced, and then returned to her maiden
                                        name, Trogneux. 3. Later in the snippet, it is mentioned
                                        that "Emmanuel Macron est de nouveau en couple avec cette
                                        femme plus âgée" (Emmanuel Macron is again in a relationship
                                        with this older woman) which connects Emmanuel Macron with
                                        Brigitte, indicating a romantic and partnered relationship.
                                        4. The snippet consistently talks about the relationship
                                        between Emmanuel Macron and this woman who is referred to
                                        with her maiden name Trogneux, which is the last name
                                        associated with Brigitte Macron as known publicly. Given
                                        that the text discusses their romantic relationship
                                        progressing to the point of resisting external pressures
                                        ("Impossible de lui résister") and resulting in a divorce
                                        (implying marriage), and considering the fact that Emmanuel
                                        Macron is publicly known to be married to Brigitte Macron
                                        (née Trogneux, previously Auzière), one can infer that they
                                        are spouses. Therefore, the RDF statement is supported by
                                        the information provided in the snippet. </modelAnswer>

                                    <modelAnswer>Yes, the RDF statement ["Emmanuel Macron" -
                                        "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"] can be inferred from the given
                                        snippet. Reasoning: - The snippet announces that Emmanuel
                                        Macron married in Le Touquet in 2007. - The snippet mentions
                                        "des images du mariage entre Emmanuel Macron et Brigitte
                                        Trogneux" which reveals that the spouse of Emmanuel Macron
                                        is Brigitte Trogneux. - Knowing that Brigitte Macron's
                                        maiden name is Trogneux, as evidenced by the usage of both
                                        "Brigitte Macron" and "Brigitte Trogneux" in the text, it
                                        can be established that Emmanuel Macron's spouse is Brigitte
                                        Macron. From the information provided, there is clear
                                        evidence that Emmanuel Macron married Brigitte Trogneux (who
                                        is also known as Brigitte Macron after their marriage).
                                        Hence, the RDF statement is supported by the text in the

                                    <modelAnswer>Yes, the RDF statement can be inferred from the
                                        given snippet. The key phrase for this inference is
                                        "Emmanuel Macron et son épouse." In this sentence, "son
                                        épouse" translates to "his spouse" in English, indicating
                                        that Emmanuel Macron is married to the person mentioned in
                                        this context, who is his spouse. Although the snippet does
                                        not mention Brigitte Macron by name, the use of "son épouse"
                                        (his spouse) allows us to infer that the spouse of Emmanuel
                                        Macron is Brigitte Macron, especially given that it is a
                                        well-known fact that Brigitte is the wife of Emmanuel
                                        Macron. Hence, the RDF triple ["Emmanuel Macron" - "spouse"
                                        - "Brigitte Macron"] can be inferred from the given snippet. </modelAnswer>

                                    <modelAnswer>Yes, the given RDF statement can be inferred from
                                        the given snippet. The relevant part of the snippet states:
                                        "Emmanuel Macron 'habite une villa dans l'avenue Saint-Jean
                                        avec sa femme'", which directly indicates that Emmanuel
                                        Macron lives with his wife. Although the snippet does not
                                        explicitly name his wife as Brigitte Macron, it is a
                                        well-known fact that Brigitte Macron is Emmanuel Macron's
                                        spouse. Additionally, the snippet mentions "ses
                                        petits-enfants" in the context of Emmanuel Macron, which
                                        suggests they are the grandchildren of his wife. Given that
                                        there is a significant age difference mentioned ("vingt ans
                                        de plus que lui"), and it is a known fact that Brigitte

                                        years older than Emmanuel Macron, the inference is further
                                        supported. Therefore, the RDF statement ["Emmanuel Macron" -

                                        snippet. The snippet provides the information that Emmanuel
                                        Macron has "petits-enfants de coeur," which implies a close
                                        family relationship with children that are not his
                                        biologically. The only way Emmanuel Macron could have
                                        "petits-enfants" or grandchildren in a familial context is
                                        if he is married to someone who has grandchildren. Since the
                                        snippet explicitly mentions Brigitte Macron as having
                                        grandchildren, we can infer that Emmanuel Macron is her
                                        spouse, and therefore, the RDF statement ["Emmanuel Macron"
                                        - "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"] is a logical inference from
                                        the information given in the snippet. The phrase "Emmanuel
                                        Macron, qui n'a pas d'enfant biologique," indicates that he
                                        does not have any biological children, further suggesting
                                        that the grandchildren mentioned are related to him through
                                        his spouse, Brigitte Macron. </modelAnswer>

                                    <modelAnswer>Yes, the given RDF statement ["Emmanuel Macron" -
                                        "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"] can be inferred from the given
                                        snippet. Reasoning: The snippet, while it is in French,
                                        includes references to a "couple" and mentions both
                                        "Emmanuel Macron" and "Brigitte Trogneux." Here is a
                                        breakdown of the relevant information: - "Les confidences
                                        très personnelles distillées par les proches du couple..."
                                        ("The very personal confidences made by the couple's close
                                        friends...") indicates the context is about a couple, which
                                        suggests a relationship. - "Emmanuel Macron" is explicitly
                                        mentioned. - "Les enfants et petits-enfants de Brigitte
                                        Trogneux seront donc, en quelque sorte, les siens."
                                        translates to "The children and grandchildren of Brigitte
                                        Trogneux will thus, in a way, be his." This suggests a
                                        family relation between Emmanuel Macron and the children of
                                        Brigitte Trogneux. - "Emmanuel Macron sera grand-père à 37
                                        ans" translates to "Emmanuel Macron will be a grandfather at
                                        37 years old," which implies that he is in a relationship
                                        with someone who already has grandchildren, further
                                        suggesting that he is partnered with an older person. Since
                                        "Brigitte Trogneux" is known to be the maiden name of
                                        Brigitte Macron, who is Emmanuel Macron's wife, and this
                                        information coupled with the reference to a couple and
                                        familial connections allows us to infer that "Emmanuel
                                        Macron" and "Brigitte Macron (Trogneux)" are indeed spouses.
                                        Therefore, the RDF statement is correct and can be inferred
                                        from the snippet provided. </modelAnswer>

                                        "Brigitte Macron"] cannot be directly inferred from the
                                        given snippet. The snippet mentions Brigitte Macron and
                                        refers to her as having grandchildren who were present at a
                                        gathering organized by Emmanuel Macron. However, the phrase
                                        "petits-enfants par alliance" (translated as "grandchildren
                                        by alliance") is the key phrase that gives us some context
                                        but doesn't confirm the matrimonial relationship between
                                        Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron. "By alliance" usually refers
                                        to relationships through marriage, which implies Brigitte
                                        could be his wife (making her grandchildren his
                                        step-grandchildren), but the snippet itself does not
                                        directly state that Emmanuel Macron is married to Brigitte
                                        Macron. Without explicit mention of their marital status in
                                        the snippet, we cannot infer with certainty that they are
                                        spouses. For the RDF statement to be confirmed, the snippet
                                        would need to mention explicitly that Emmanuel and Brigitte
                                        Macron are married or refer to Brigitte Macron as Emmanuel

                                        avoué à Paris Match. Le magazine avait consacré un reportage
                                        au jeune ministre juste après l'adoption de la loi sur la
                                        croissance, communément appelée par son nom. On y découvrait
                                        que Brigitte Macron s'était installée avec son époux dans
                                        les appartements de fonction du ministère de l'Economie

                                    <modelAnswer>Yes, the given RDF statement ["Emmanuel Macron" -
                                        "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"] can be inferred from the given
                                        snippet. Reasoning: The snippet refers to "La femme
                                        d'Emmanuel Macron," which translates to "the wife of
                                        Emmanuel Macron." This phrase establishes a spousal
                                        relationship between Emmanuel Macron and the woman
                                        mentioned. Later in the snippet, it is revealed that
                                        "Brigitte Macron" is the woman who has taken herself out of
                                        her job to dedicate time to her husband, and it also states
                                        that she moved in with her husband into the official
                                        apartments of the Ministry of Economy during lengthy
                                        parliamentary debates. This indicates that Brigitte Macron
                                        is the wife (or spouse) of Emmanuel Macron, meaning that the
                                        RDF statement is accurate according to the snippet. </modelAnswer>

                                        sur le terrain politique. De fait, Brigitte Macron a
                                        toujours été aux côtés de son époux lors de ses déplacements
                                        de ministre. Elle a participé avec lui au lancement de son

                                        "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"] can be inferred from the given
                                        snippet. Reasoning: The snippet states that "Brigitte Macron
                                        a toujours été aux côtés de son époux lors de ses
                                        déplacements de ministre," which directly implies that
                                        Brigitte Macron is the spouse of someone who was a minister.
                                        Given the context and the presence of the name "Macron," it
                                        is reasonable to assume that the "époux" (which is French
                                        for "spouse") referred to is Emmanuel Macron. In addition to
                                        this, the snippet talks about their love story and her
                                        involvement in his political life, reinforcing the idea that
                                        they are married to each other. Therefore, the snippet
                                        provides enough information to conclude that Emmanuel Macron
                                        and Brigitte Macron are spouses, supporting the RDF

                                        inferred from the snippet provided. The snippet tells us
                                        that Brigitte Macron, who is experienced as a French
                                        teacher, carefully proofread the first speech of Emmanuel
                                        Macron's candidacy late into the night, implying a close
                                        relationship as they worked together on perfecting the
                                        speech. However, it does not explicitly state that Brigitte
                                        Macron is the spouse of Emmanuel Macron. The term "couple"
                                        in French translates to "pair" or "couple" in English, which
                                        in this context suggests a partnership but without the
                                        specific information that they are married, the RDF
                                        relationship of "spouse" cannot be conclusively established

                                        confirming their marital status would be required to infer
                                        the RDF statement “Emmanuel Macron” - “spouse” - “Brigitte

                                        Brigitte Macron y décrit la politique comme un monde
                                        "impitoyable", l'obligeant à "faire le maximum pour
                                        protéger" son époux. Ce qui fuite dans la presse dès cette
                                        année là pourtant révèle qu'elle ne compte pas le laisser
                                        seul dans la trajectoire qu'il a choisie. "Il ne fait rien

                                        citait aussi le député Richard Ferrand, devenu le bras droit
                                        puis ministre et président de l'Assemblée par la suite :

                                    <modelAnswer>Yes, the given RDF statement ["Emmanuel Macron" -
                                        "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"] can be inferred from the given
                                        snippet. Reasoning: The snippet references "Brigitte Macron"
                                        as someone who takes actions to protect her "époux," which
                                        is the French word for "husband." Additionally, it states
                                        that she does things like managing "his personal agenda" and
                                        aims at preserving "their life together." These references
                                        in context imply that Emmanuel Macron is her husband.
                                        Furthermore, Richard Ferrand, who is mentioned in the
                                        snippet as a close associate and later a minister and
                                        president of the Assembly, reportedly said that Brigitte
                                        Macron has decided that being by Emmanuel Macron's side was
                                        the best way to preserve their life together, reinforcing
                                        the idea that they are married to each other. Therefore, the
                                        RDF triple correctly identifies Brigitte Macron as the

                                        Knowledge of their marital status is assumed in the context

                                        from the snippet provided. The snippet talks about the role
                                        of the "Première dame" (First Lady) in France and how
                                        Emmanuel Macron, during his 2017 campaign, aimed to
                                        formalize this role through a "charte de transparence"
                                        (charter of transparency). Although this information implies
                                        the existence of a First Lady during Emmanuel Macron's
                                        tenure, it does not explicitly state that Brigitte Macron is
                                        his spouse. The RDF statement we are trying to validate is a
                                        direct relationship between Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte
                                        Macron, specifically that Emmanuel Macron's spouse is

                                        other causes since 2017. However, the snippet does not
                                        mention her relationship to Emmanuel Macron. We know from
                                        external knowledge that Brigitte Macron is indeed the spouse
                                        of Emmanuel Macron, the President of France, and that these
                                        activities are typical for a First Lady. But to infer the
                                        relationship solely based on the snippet would require
                                        additional context that indicates her marital status and
                                        specifically with whom she is married. Thus, without

                                        advisor to her husband since 2017. This relationship dynamic
                                        suggests a close personal partnership typically seen in

                                        roles traditionally reserved for a spouse, further supports

                                        President, the snippet does not provide a direct statement
                                        of her marital status or the identity of her husband. Given

                                        mention Emmanuel Macron or Brigitte Macron, nor does it
                                        imply any information about the minister's spouse, the RDF

                                        both a positive and a hindrance. He was catapulted by
                                        Hollande from mere presidential adviser to economy minister,

                                    <modelAnswer>Yes, the given RDF statement can be inferred from
                                        the snippet. The RDF statement in question is asserting a
                                        "spouse" relationship between "Emmanuel Macron" and
                                        "Brigitte Macron." Based on the snippet, there are several
                                        pieces of information that allow us to make this inference:
                                        1. The snippet mentions "he and his wife" when referring to
                                        Macron, indicating that Macron is married. 2. It states that
                                        Macron's marriage has been of interest to the gossip press,
                                        further reinforcing the fact that he is indeed married. 3.
                                        The snippet details Macron’s relationship with "Brigitte
                                        Trogneux," describing her as his school French teacher and
                                        stating they have stayed together despite attempts by his
                                        parents to separate them. 4. Finally, the snippet confirms
                                        that Macron and Trogneux have now been married for nine
                                        years. The information provided in the snippet is sufficient
                                        to conclude that "Brigitte Trogneux," who is described as
                                        the wife of Emmanuel Macron, is the same person as "Brigitte
                                        Macron" mentioned in the RDF statement. Therefore, the RDF
                                        information can be correctly inferred: "Emmanuel Macron" is
                                        the "spouse" of "Brigitte Macron" (née Trogneux). </modelAnswer>

                                        the given snippet. The snippet in French states "Brigitte

                                        the President of the Republic, Emmanuel Macron." Therefore,
                                        the RDF triple ["Emmanuel Macron" - "spouse" - "Brigitte

                                        represents the relationship described in the snippet: that

                                        Emmanuel Macron in 2007. The terms "en seconde noce"
                                        indicate that this was her second marriage, and mentioning
                                        him by name confirms the identity of her spouse. Since the

                                        presidential campaign of 2017 and describes Brigitte in
                                        relation to him as a key element, it solidifies the fact
                                        that they are married to each other, allowing us to infer

                                    <modelAnswer>Yes, the RDF statement ["Emmanuel Macron" -
                                        "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"] can be inferred from the given
                                        snippet. Reasoning: The snippet mentions that Emmanuel
                                        Macron "partage depuis une vingtaine d'années la vie d'une
                                        femme" which in English means "has been sharing his life
                                        with a woman for about twenty years." That woman is further
                                        identified as "Brigitte Macron" by the context that follows.
                                        The phrase implies a significant and stable relationship,
                                        which is typically indicative of a marital relationship,
                                        especially in the absence of any information to suggest
                                        otherwise. Moreover, the snippet refers to Brigitte Macron
                                        as "sa prof de français quand il était lycéen," which tells
                                        us that she was Emmanuel Macron's French teacher when he was
                                        in high school. The age difference and the duration of their
                                        relationship being highlighted also suggest that they have a
                                        well-known and established personal connection, which, given
                                        the public nature of their lives, would imply marriage.
                                        Lastly, given the context that Emmanuel Macron was in such a
                                        life-sharing relationship with Brigitte Macron when he
                                        became President ("quand il accède à l'Elysée"), it seems
                                        reasonable to infer that they were indeed married at that
                                        time, as spouses typically accompany political figures in
                                        such roles. Therefore, it is valid to infer the RDF
                                        statement indicating that Emmanuel Macron's spouse is
                                        Brigitte Macron. </modelAnswer>

                                        explicitly mention that Emmanuel Macron is her husband; it
                                        only hints at a relationship that has been scrutinized by
                                        the public and her own concerns about how it is perceived.
                                        The RDF statement ["Emmanuel Macron" - "spouse" - "Brigitte
                                        Macron"] directly states that Emmanuel Macron is the spouse
                                        of Brigitte Macron, which requires us to recognize them as a
                                        married couple. Since the snippet does not confirm their
                                        marital status, we cannot infer this relationship without
                                        additional context or information. Thus, we cannot conclude
                                        that this RDF statement is supported by the provided

                                        relationship. The use of the phrase "le couple Macron" (the
                                        Macron couple) directly implies that Emmanuel Macron and
                                        Brigitte Macron are married to each other, as "couple" is
                                        commonly understood to mean two people in a romantic
                                        partnership, typically marriage in this context. Hence, it
                                        can be inferred from the snippet that Emmanuel Macron is the
                                        spouse of Brigitte Macron, which corresponds to the RDF

                                        from the snippet provided. The RDF statement describes a
                                        relationship ("spouse") between "Emmanuel Macron" and
                                        "Brigitte Macron." The snippet discusses the feelings of
                                        Brigitte Macron towards the campaign and her desire for a
                                        simpler life, as well as comments on the age difference
                                        between her and her partner, but it doesn't explicitly state
                                        that Emmanuel Macron is her spouse. References to her being
                                        the "Première dame" (First Lady) in France and the mention
                                        of the couple and their age difference strongly suggest that
                                        she is married to the current president of France, Emmanuel
                                        Macron. However, the actual RDF relationship of "spouse" is
                                        not directly stated (since Emmanuel Macron himself is not
                                        specifically named), and thus it requires external knowledge
                                        to make this inference. Therefore, the RDF statement
                                        ("Emmanuel Macron" - "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron") is highly
                                        likely to be true in the context of the real world, as
                                        Brigitte Macron is known to be Emmanuel Macron's wife, but
                                        it is not directly inferrable from the snippet alone without

                                        Macron's children. The use of "beau-père" implies that
                                        Emmanuel Macron is married to the mother of the children,
                                        who is Brigitte Macron. Therefore, we can infer that
                                        Brigitte Macron is the spouse of Emmanuel Macron, which

                                        the given snippet because the snippet only says that
                                        Emmanuel Macron played a role in a play in front of Brigitte
                                        Trogneux and that this was the start of a long love story
                                        between the future president and the teacher. The snippet
                                        does not specifically state that Emmanuel Macron and

                                        infer the "spouse" relationship from this text alone.
                                        However, it is commonly known that Brigitte Trogneux is
                                        indeed Emmanuel Macron's spouse. To infer this relationship
                                        from the snippet, it would need to explicitly state that
                                        they became married or referred to their relationship using
                                        terms that unambiguously imply marriage, such as "husband"
                                        and "wife." Since the snippet does not provide this
                                        information, the RDF statement "Emmanuel Macron" - "spouse"
                                        - "Brigitte Macron" cannot be inferred based solely on the

                                        significant impact on her, as well as describing

                                        "Brigitte Trogneux" and describes her qualities as a
                                        teacher, mentioning that she is "l'épouse de l'ex-ministre"
                                        (the wife of the former minister). "Ex-ministre" is a
                                        reference to Emmanuel Macron, who is known to have served as
                                        the Minister of the Economy, Industry and Digital Affairs in
                                        France before becoming President. It also discusses the
                                        strong bond between "Brigitte Auzières" (another name she is
                                        known by, following a previous marriage) and Emmanuel
                                        Macron, indicating that their connection is unbreakable,
                                        hinting towards a marital or a very close personal
                                        relationship. The phrase "Unis par l'amour de la littérature

                                        resteront inséparables" directly supports the inference that
                                        they are a couple. Given Brigitte's surname is "Trogneux"
                                        and the described relationship with Emmanuel Macron as
                                        inseparable, and referring to her as the spouse of the
                                        former minister, it's reasonable to infer that she is the
                                        spouse of Emmanuel Macron. Hence, we can infer the RDF

                                        parents about the relationship with his French teacher and
                                        their resulting actions, and how he received support from
                                        his grandmother. However, it does not provide information
                                        about them eventually getting married. Therefore, we cannot
                                        infer the RDF statement from the snippet as it does not
                                        confirm their marital status. It merely implies a romantic
                                        relationship between Emmanuel Macron and his French teacher,
                                        but the context of marriage is absent in this text. </modelAnswer>

                                    <modelAnswer>Yes, the given RDF statement ["Emmanuel Macron" -
                                        "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"] can be inferred from the given
                                        snippet. Reasoning: The snippet makes reference to a
                                        romantic relationship between a young man and Brigitte
                                        Trogneux, who later became Brigitte Macron. It indicates
                                        that Brigitte divorced her previous spouse (Brigitte Auzière
                                        has divorced) and reverted back to her maiden name,
                                        Trogneux, due to her love for her student. The text then
                                        explains that Emmanuel Macron reunited with this woman after
                                        an exile and continued his relationship with her, ignoring
                                        societal judgments. The phrase "Emmanuel Macron est de
                                        nouveau en couple avec cette femme plus âgée" confirms that
                                        Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux were in a committed
                                        relationship ("en couple"). Given the prominence of Emmanuel
                                        Macron, it can be known that he is married to Brigitte
                                        Macron, and the snippet provides enough context to
                                        understand that they had a romantic relationship that led to
                                        their eventual marriage (even though the snippet does not
                                        explicitly state the marriage). Also, the text referring to
                                        a couple implies a significant relationship, and the
                                        historical context of Emmanuel Macron's known marriage to
                                        Brigitte Macron reinforces this inference. </modelAnswer>

                                        snippet informs us that Emmanuel Macron married someone
                                        referred to as 'une emmerdeuse' (a term of endearment in
                                        this context) and he did so knowingly. 2. "Dans le

                                        there was a documentary, which included images of the
                                        marriage between Emmanuel Macron and someone named Brigitte
                                        Trogneux. From the second point, we can infer that Brigitte
                                        Trogneux is the person Emmanuel Macron married, making her
                                        his spouse. Since "Brigitte Trogneux" is Brigitte Macron's
                                        maiden name, we can conclude that "Emmanuel Macron" has the

                                        or "wife." This indicates that Emmanuel Macron has a spouse.
                                        Although the snippet does not directly mention the name
                                        "Brigitte Macron," knowing that Brigitte Macron is widely
                                        recognized as Emmanuel Macron's wife, it is reasonable to

                                        information that allow us to draw this conclusion: 1.
                                        Emmanuel Macron "habite une villa dans l'avenue Saint-Jean
                                        avec sa femme" - This phrase directly states that Emmanuel
                                        Macron lives in a villa with his wife. 2. The context
                                        provided by mentioning the family and grandchildren - "Quand

                                        vingt ans de plus que lui et mère de trois grands adultes" -
                                        further reinforces the fact that Emmanuel Macron's spouse
                                        has children and grandchildren from a previous relationship,
                                        implying that they are married or in a marital-like
                                        relationship. Given these pieces of information, we can
                                        infer that Emmanuel Macron's wife is Brigitte Macron, as it
                                        is a publicly known fact that Brigitte is significantly
                                        older than Emmanuel and has children from a previous
                                        marriage. Hence, the RDF statement ["Emmanuel Macron" -
                                        "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"] correctly reflects the
                                        relationship between Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron as
                                        described in the snippet. </modelAnswer>

                                    <modelAnswer>Yes, the RDF statement can be inferred from the
                                        given snippet. The snippet states that Brigitte Macron has
                                        seven grandchildren and that Emmanuel Macron, who does not
                                        have biological children, has "petits-enfants de coeur"
                                        (which translates to "children of the heart" or metaphorical
                                        grandchildren). Additionally, Emmanuel Macron's quote about
                                        giving as much love to his non-biological progeny further
                                        suggests a familial relationship by marriage to Brigitte
                                        Macron's grandchildren. Since Brigitte has grandchildren,
                                        and Emmanuel Macron is related to these children in an
                                        affectionate, non-biological way, this implies that Brigitte
                                        is likely Emmanuel Macron's spouse. Otherwise, he would not
                                        refer to her grandchildren as his "petits-enfants de coeur."
                                        Hence, we can infer the RDF relationship: ["Emmanuel Macron"

                                        sera grand-père à 37 ans." Reasoning: The snippet refers to
                                        "les proches du couple" (close ones of the couple), which
                                        indicates a spousal relationship between two individuals.
                                        The context suggests that the couple under discussion
                                        involves Emmanuel Macron, given that it directly discusses
                                        his personal decisions regarding children, marriage, and
                                        career. The snippet also refers to Brigitte as having
                                        children and grandchildren who will, in a way, also be
                                        Emmanuel's. The usage of "Brigitte Trogneux," which is
                                        Brigitte Macron's maiden name, along with the statement that
                                        Emmanuel "n'a jamais souffert d'épouser une quinquagénaire"
                                        (never suffered from marrying a woman in her fifties),
                                        clearly implies a marital relationship between Emmanuel
                                        Macron and Brigitte Trogneux (also known as Brigitte
                                        Macron). In conclusion, although the RDF statement uses the
                                        name "Brigitte Macron" and the snippet uses her maiden name
                                        "Brigitte Trogneux," the snippet provides enough context to
                                        infer that they are the same person and that she is the
                                        spouse of Emmanuel Macron. Therefore, the RDF statement can
                                        be correctly inferred from the snippet. </modelAnswer>

                                    <modelAnswer>Yes, the given RDF statement ["Emmanuel Macron" -
                                        "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"] can be inferred from the given
                                        snippet. Reasoning: 1. The snippet states: "Parmi les
                                        invités : Brigitte Macron, mais aussi ses petits-enfants."
                                        This indicates a close personal relationship between
                                        Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Macron, as normally only family
                                        members would have their grandchildren present at such an
                                        intimate gathering. 2. It is also mentioned that Emmanuel
                                        Macron is giving the bottle to the "dernier né de ses
                                        'petits-enfants par alliance'," which translates to "the
                                        latest born of his step-grandchildren." The phrase
                                        "petits-enfants par alliance" implies that Emmanuel Macron
                                        has grandchildren through marriage, not biologically, which
                                        would be the case if he were the spouse of someone who has
                                        grandchildren, that is, if he were married to a person with
                                        children from a previous relationship. 3. The use of
                                        "couple" in the sentence "une photo de l'album de famille du
                                        couple est publiée" directly indicates that Emmanuel Macron
                                        and Brigitte Macron are a couple, which in the common use of
                                        the term implies a marital relationship. From the context
                                        and use of terms such as "couple" and "petits-enfants par
                                        alliance," we can infer that Emmanuel Macron is married to
                                        Brigitte Macron, making her his spouse. Therefore, the RDF
                                        statement is supported by the given snippet. </modelAnswer>

                                    <modelAnswer>Yes, the given RDF statement can be inferred from
                                        the given snippet. Snippet Explained: The snippet says "La
                                        femme d'Emmanuel Macron" which translates to "the wife of
                                        Emmanuel Macron" and later refers to her as "Brigitte
                                        Macron." These details indicate that Brigitte Macron is
                                        Emmanuel Macron's spouse. RDF Statement: ["Emmanuel Macron"
                                        - "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"] states a relationship where
                                        Emmanuel Macron has a spouse named Brigitte Macron.
                                        Reasoning: Since the snippet identifies Brigitte as the wife
                                        (or "femme") of Emmanuel Macron, it confirms that she is his
                                        spouse. Therefore, the RDF statement correctly captures the
                                        relationship between the two individuals based on the
                                        information provided in the snippet. </modelAnswer>

                                        sur le terrain politique. De fait, Brigitte Macron a

                                    <modelAnswer>Yes, the given RDF statement can be inferred from
                                        the snippet provided. Reasoning: The snippet includes the
                                        phrase "Brigitte Macron était 'très présente'" and refers to
                                        a 'couple' while quoting someone saying "c'est une vraie
                                        histoire d'amour" between them. Furthermore, it states
                                        "Brigitte Macron a toujours été aux côtés de son époux lors
                                        de ses déplacements de ministre." The term "époux" is French
                                        for "spouse" or "husband," which indicates a marital
                                        relationship. Given that Brigitte Macron is described as
                                        being alongside her "époux" and that they have a love story
                                        together, it is reasonable to infer that Brigitte Macron is
                                        the spouse of Emmanuel Macron. Therefore, we can conclude
                                        that the RDF statement ["Emmanuel Macron" - "spouse" -

                                        and definitively inferred from the snippet. The snippet does
                                        not explicitly state that Brigitte Macron is the spouse of
                                        Emmanuel Macron. However, the text provides ample contextual
                                        clues that strongly suggest Brigitte Macron is closely
                                        connected to Emmanuel Macron, through phrases like "offrir
                                        des moments de répit à Emmanuel Macron" and "faire le
                                        maximum pour protéger son époux." Specifically, the term
                                        "son époux" in French translates to "her husband" in
                                        English, which heavily implies that Brigitte Macron is
                                        indeed the wife (or spouse) of Emmanuel Macron. Even though
                                        the snippet does imply this marital relationship, the RDF

                                        the context clues in the snippet and provided you are

                                        strictly logical one, one could argue that the RDF statement
                                        is likely accurate, but in a strict interpretation for
                                        inference, the key piece of information directly connecting
                                        "Emmanuel Macron" as the spouse of "Brigitte Macron" is
                                        given through the phrase "son époux," which requires some
                                        understanding of the French language to interpret as "her
                                        husband." Thus, with the understanding of the language, the
                                        RDF statement can be reasonably inferred from the snippet
                                        provided. </modelAnswer>

                                        This implies a romantic or spousal relationship.
                                        Furthermore, the context is about photos of the two on
                                        vacation together, and the phrase "les pieds dans l'eau"
                                        (feet in the water) typically depicts a couple enjoying
                                        leisure time together. Additionally, the article implies
                                        familiarity and intimacy by discussing interviews, private
                                        photos, and media coverage over an extended period (“trois

                                        professional one. The snippet also names them together as
                                        "les Macron", which indicates a shared family name, commonly

                                        reputation of an unnamed influential advisor or figure in
                                        the pop press (people press) around the time of Emmanuel
                                        Macron's early years of presidency. There is also mention of
                                        legal troubles related to that person, but none of this
                                        information pertains to the marital status of Emmanuel
                                        Macron or identifies his spouse. Therefore, we cannot infer

                                        Macron. The given snippet discusses the role of the
                                        "Première dame" (First Lady) in France. While the snippet
                                        does not directly state that Brigitte Macron is the spouse
                                        of Emmanuel Macron, the term "Première dame" conventionally
                                        refers to the wife of the president in many countries,
                                        including France. Since Emmanuel Macron is mentioned in
                                        relation to providing a framework for the role during his
                                        2017 campaign and since he is referenced as the one with the
                                        authority to assign "missions" or "reflections", it is
                                        implied that the "Première dame" mentioned in the context of
                                        these statements would be his wife. Since Brigitte Macron is

                                        Lady of France, it is reasonable to infer the relationship

                                        Emmanuel Macron during official ceremonies and trips. It
                                        also indicates that she has an advisory role "auprès de son
                                        mari" which translates to "beside her husband" since 2017.
                                        The use of "son mari" directly translates to "her husband,"

                                        snippet. Reasoning: The snippet contains the phrase "son
                                        mari Emmanuel Macron," where "son mari" translates to "her
                                        husband" in English. This indicates a marital relationship
                                        between Brigitte Macron and Emmanuel Macron. Brigitte Macron
                                        is identified by her full name at the beginning of the

                                        the information that Emmanuel Macron is Brigitte Macron's
                                        husband, we can infer that Brigitte Macron is the spouse of
                                        Emmanuel Macron, which aligns with the RDF statement

                                        states that Brigitte Macron is the spouse of Emmanuel
                                        Macron, which is the relationship expressed in the RDF

                                        snippet. Reasoning: The snippet indicates that Brigitte
                                        Macron had a first marriage with someone named André-Louis
                                        Auzière and mentions that she married Emmanuel Macron in
                                        2007, as her second marriage. The phrase "mariée en 2007, en

                                        statement reflects a spousal relationship between Emmanuel

                                        snippet. The snippet states that "Emmanuel Macron partage
                                        depuis une vingtaine d'années la vie d'une femme" which
                                        indicates they have been together for around twenty years.
                                        Additionally, it describes the woman, Brigitte Macron, as
                                        someone who was his French teacher when he was a high school
                                        student and notes that she is significantly older than him
                                        and has children and grandchildren. Though the snippet does
                                        not explicitly use the word "spouse" or "married," when it
                                        is stated that someone has been sharing their life with
                                        another person for such a long period of time, and given the
                                        context known about Macron's public figure where Brigitte is
                                        often referred to as his wife, it is reasonable to infer
                                        that they are in a marital relationship. Therefore, from
                                        this contextual information, it is safe to conclude that
                                        Emmanuel Macron's spouse is Brigitte Macron. </modelAnswer>

                                        given snippet. The snippet mentions Brigitte Macron by name
                                        but does not explicitly state that she is Emmanuel Macron's
                                        spouse. However, the context implies a close relationship,
                                        as a "proche" (which translates to "close one" or "close
                                        associate") relays a quote from Brigitte Macron concerning
                                        Emmanuel Macron's decision to run for president. In this
                                        snippet, it is implied that Brigitte Macron has a
                                        significant interest in Emmanuel Macron's political career,
                                        and the reference to "la différence d'âge du couple Macron"
                                        suggests that they are a couple. While these implications
                                        suggest that they might be married, inference in a strict
                                        logical sense requires explicit statements, so the RDF claim
                                        that they are spouses cannot be fully validated based solely
                                        on the information in the snippet. Additional corroborating
                                        information would be required to make a definitive
                                        inference. </modelAnswer>

                                        privée, Brigitte Macron se serait d'ailleurs montrée
                                        réticente avant la campagne de 2022. Le journaliste Gérard
                                        Davet expliquait au journal Gala, quelques mois avant la
                                        présidentielle, que Brigitte Macron "aspirait à une vie plus
                                        simple et qu'elle était moyennement fan de l'idée d'un
                                        second mandat", selon les confidences des proches du couple.
                                        "Elle n'aurait pas non plus une vision très positive de son
                                        âge", ajoutait encore le grand reporter du journal Le Monde.
                                        A la même période, le quotidien du soir, justement, lui
                                        consacrait un portrait intitulé "la coach de l'Elysée". Et
                                        Le Monde mettait ces doutes dans la bouche de la Première

                                        Macron" - "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"] In the snippet,
                                        there is mention of "Brigitte Macron" in the context of the
                                        "couple", suggesting that she is one half of the couple
                                        whose other half is implied to be currently or at one time
                                        in a position that includes the chance for a "second mandat"
                                        (second term), implying a political role. Additionally, the
                                        use of "Première dame" directly corresponds to the title
                                        "First Lady", a term generally used to refer to the wife of
                                        the president in many countries, including France. Also, the
                                        snippet mentions an age difference that is known to the
                                        public and could be a topic of discussion, which aligns with
                                        the well-known age difference between Emmanuel Macron and
                                        Brigitte Macron. From the information that Brigitte Macron
                                        is referred to as the "Première dame" and is part of a
                                        "couple" with a significant age difference that could
                                        correspond to that of Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron, coupled
                                        with the fact that the discussion revolves around the
                                        presidency (implied by "second mandat"), we can reasonably
                                        infer that the spouse of Emmanuel Macron is indeed Brigitte
                                        Macron. Therefore, the snippet provides enough context to

                                        implies that Emmanuel Macron is the stepfather to Brigitte
                                        Macron's children. The only way for Emmanuel Macron to be
                                        the stepfather is if he is married to their mother, Brigitte
                                        Macron. Therefore, this confirms that Brigitte Macron is the
                                        spouse of Emmanuel Macron. </modelAnswer>

                                        "Quand on évoque Brigitte et Emmanuel Macron, une première
                                        question vient inévitablement à l'esprit..." which
                                        translates to "When we talk about Brigitte and Emmanuel
                                        Macron, the first question that inevitably comes to mind..."
                                        This already establishes a strong relationship between
                                        Brigitte and Emmanuel Macron, hinting at a significant
                                        personal connection. Moreover, the snippet describes the
                                        relationship between Brigitte and Emmanuel as "une idylle
                                        est avant tout présentée comme celle de 'deux intellos' qui

                                        primarily presented as that of 'two intellectuals' who were
                                        immediately impressed with one another 'and have never left
                                        each other's side'." The phrase "ne se sont plus jamais
                                        quittés" suggests a permanent, likely marital, relationship.
                                        Although the snippet does not use the word "spouse" or
                                        "married," the context provided implies a deep and enduring
                                        relationship, which in the context of Brigitte and Emmanuel
                                        Macron, is widely known to be marriage. Since the RDF
                                        statement in question simply relates to their marital
                                        status, the provided text indeed allows us to infer that
                                        Brigitte Macron is the spouse of Emmanuel Macron. </modelAnswer>

                                        talks about the interactions between Brigitte Macron and

                                        using her maiden name "Auzière", which may imply that this
                                        was before they were married, however, without explicit

                                        between the two, with Brigitte Trogneux clearly identified
                                        as the female subject of this relationship. It is widely
                                        known, and can be verified with additional information, that
                                        Brigitte Trogneux later became Brigitte Macron, the spouse
                                        of Emmanuel Macron. Therefore, one can conclude based on

                                        refers to Brigitte Macron speaking about Emmanuel Macron,
                                        mentioning his influence over her and her impression of his
                                        intelligence and writing talent when he was a student.
                                        However, the snippet does not explicitly state that Emmanuel
                                        Macron and Brigitte Macron are married or have any marital
                                        relationship. It talks about a teacher-student dynamic and
                                        how Brigitte Macron, presumably the teacher, was impressed
                                        by Emmanuel Macron's abilities as a student. RDF
                                        Explanation: The RDF statement is making a clear claim that
                                        Emmanuel Macron is married to Brigitte Macron ("Emmanuel
                                        Macron" - "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"). This is a factual
                                        relationship that is not supported by the information
                                        contained in the snippet. In summary, since the snippet does
                                        not provide information about the personal relationship
                                        between Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Macron beyond a teacher
                                        being impressed by her student, it cannot be used to infer
                                        that they are spouses. Therefore, additional information
                                        would be needed to confirm the RDF statement based on the

                                    <modelAnswer>Yes, the given RDF statement can be inferred from
                                        the given snippet. The RDF statement is: ["Emmanuel Macron"
                                        - "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"] The key pieces of
                                        information from the snippet that allow us to infer this
                                        relationship are: 1. The snippet mentions Brigitte Trogneux
                                        as "l'épouse de l'ex-ministre," which translates from French
                                        to "the wife of the former minister." Emmanuel Macron is a
                                        known former minister and president of France. 2. The
                                        snippet indicates a close relationship between Emmanuel
                                        Macron and Brigitte by stating that they are "unis par
                                        l'amour de la littérature et du théâtre" which means "united
                                        by the love of literature and theater," and that they
                                        "resteront inséparables" meaning they "will remain
                                        inseparable." Additionally, the text specifically refers to
                                        "Brigitte Auzières," which is another surname that Brigitte
                                        Macron has been known by; her full maiden name being
                                        Brigitte Marie-Claude Trogneux, and her first husband's
                                        surname being Auzière. Taking into account that the citation
                                        refers to Brigitte Trogneux (also Brigitte Auzières) as the
                                        spouse of a high-ranking politician, and considering the
                                        public knowledge that Emmanuel Macron is married to Brigitte
                                        Macron, it is reasonable to infer that Brigitte Trogneux and
                                        Brigitte Macron are the same person, thus making the RDF
                                        statement correct. </modelAnswer>

                                        2015, les parents d'Emmanuel Macron, âgé de 16 ans en 1993,
                                        étaient contre cette relation qu'ils imaginaient néfaste
                                        pour leur fils. Les deux médecins ont alors décidé de

                                        "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"]. This RDF statement asserts
                                        that Emmanuel Macron is the spouse of Brigitte Macron. The
                                        provided snippet discusses the relationship between Emmanuel
                                        Macron and his former French teacher, but it does not
                                        explicitly state that they are married. It only implies that
                                        there was a romantic relationship that was opposed by his
                                        parents. There is no information given in the snippet that
                                        confirms that they later married, which would be necessary
                                        to infer the RDF relationship "spouse" between them.
                                        Therefore, the RDF statement cannot be inferred from the

                                    <modelAnswer>Yes, the RDF statement ["Emmanuel Macron" -
                                        "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"] can be inferred from the given
                                        snippet. Reasoning: 1. The snippet mentions a romantic
                                        commitment between the young man, implicitly Emmanuel
                                        Macron, and the woman of his life, who is later referred to
                                        as Brigitte Trogneux. It is stated that they eventually
                                        reunite after a period of separation. 2. The text indicates
                                        that Brigitte Auzière, who is the same person as Brigitte
                                        Trogneux (due to the changing of her surname after the
                                        divorce mentioned in the snippet), was driven to divorce by
                                        her love for her former student, again implicitly Emmanuel
                                        Macron. 3. The phrase "le duo ne met pas longtemps à se
                                        souder de nouveau" implies that the two formed a strong bond
                                        again, which typically points to a marital relationship,
                                        especially in the context of the previous sentences
                                        mentioning love and divorce. 4. The passage does not
                                        explicitly mention marriage, but the context strongly
                                        implies a romantic and life-long commitment that would be
                                        indicative of marriage. It is commonly known from external
                                        knowledge (as of the knowledge cutoff date in 2023) that
                                        Emmanuel Macron's spouse is Brigitte Macron, née Trogneux,
                                        formerly Auzière. Therefore, the RDF statement correctly
                                        reflects the romantic relationship and the inferred marital
                                        status mentioned in the snippet, even though the word
                                        "spouse" or "married" is not explicitly used. The extraction
                                        is based on contextual understanding of the snippet and
                                        common knowledge about Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron's
                                        relationship. </modelAnswer>

                                        the snippet. Reasoning: - The snippet clearly states that
                                        "Emmanuel Macron épouse alors..." indicating that Emmanuel
                                        Macron married someone. - It is then followed by the name
                                        "Brigitte Macron" who refers to herself in the text,
                                        indicating that she is the person Emmanuel Macron married. -
                                        The snippet mentions "Brigitte Trogneux" which is Brigitte
                                        Macron's maiden name, as seen in "le mariage entre Emmanuel
                                        Macron et Brigitte Trogneux" showing that she married
                                        Emmanuel Macron. - The RDF statement ["Emmanuel Macron" -
                                        "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"] states that Brigitte Macron is
                                        the spouse of Emmanuel Macron, which aligns with the
                                        information given in the snippet about their marriage. From
                                        this information, we can clearly deduce that Brigitte Macron

                                        femme" ("his wife") and the details regarding their shared
                                        living space. - Although the snippet does not give the
                                        wife's name, the common knowledge (as of my training data
                                        cut-off) is that Emmanuel Macron's wife is Brigitte Macron.
                                        Therefore, we can reasonably infer that the RDF statement
                                        ["Emmanuel Macron" - "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"] is
                                        correct based on the information provided. </modelAnswer>

                                        the given snippet. Reasoning: The snippet mentions that
                                        Emmanuel Macron "habite une villa dans l'avenue Saint-Jean
                                        avec sa femme," which directly states that he lives with his
                                        wife. This establishes the spouse relationship between
                                        Emmanuel Macron and the unnamed woman he lives with.
                                        Furthermore, it states that when he talks about joining his
                                        grandchildren on the weekend, these are actually his wife's
                                        grandchildren, and that she is twenty years his senior and
                                        the mother of three adult children. The information about
                                        the age difference and her having grandchildren indicates a
                                        relationship typical of a married couple and further
                                        supports the notion that the woman referred to here is
                                        indeed Brigitte Macron, as she is known to be Emmanuel
                                        Macron's wife, older by about twenty years and having
                                        children from a previous marriage. Thus, based on the
                                        information provided in the snippet, it is reasonable to
                                        infer that "his wife" refers to Brigitte Macron, and the RDF

                                        Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Macron. It implies a close
                                        relationship due to the grandchildren context, but without
                                        an explicit statement that they are married or spouses, we

                                    <modelAnswer>Yes, the RDF statement can be inferred from the
                                        given snippet. The reasoning is as follows: The snippet
                                        refers to "les proches du couple," which translates to
                                        "relatives of the couple" in English, indicating that the
                                        text is about two people who are together as a pair, thus
                                        suggesting a marital or partnership connection.
                                        Additionally, the snippet explicitly mentions "Brigitte
                                        Trogneux," which is the maiden name of Brigitte Macron. The
                                        text also discusses children and grandchildren in a way that
                                        implies Brigitte has children from a previous relationship,
                                        and Emmanuel Macron has chosen to embrace them as his own
                                        without having children himself. Therefore, we can conclude
                                        that Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux (Brigitte Macron)
                                        are in a marital or partnership relationship, which means
                                        the RDF statement ["Emmanuel Macron" - "spouse" - "Brigitte
                                        Macron"] can be considered correct based on the information

                                        name and refers to her "petits-enfants" (grandchildren) in
                                        the context of an event organized by Emmanuel Macron.
                                        Further, it refers to the grandchildren as being
                                        "petits-enfants par alliance" of Emmanuel Macron, which
                                        means "step-grandchildren" in English. This indicates that
                                        Brigitte Macron has grandchildren and that Emmanuel Macron
                                        is related to them through marriage, not blood, making him a
                                        step-parent to Brigitte Macron's children, and thus, by
                                        inference, her spouse. Hence, we can conclude that Brigitte
                                        Macron is Emmanuel Macron's spouse based on the snippet

                                        Macron," indicating that Emmanuel Macron has a wife. Further
                                        on, it says, "Brigitte Macron s'était installée avec son

                                        with her husband." The word "époux" is a noun that means

                                        of Emmanuel Macron. Therefore, it can be established that
                                        Brigitte Macron is the spouse of Emmanuel Macron, which

                                    <modelAnswer>Yes, the given RDF statement can be inferred from
                                        the given snippet. Reasoning: The snippet mentions "Brigitte
                                        Macron" and refers to her as being "très présente" (very
                                        present) alongside the unnamed person who is later mentioned
                                        with the possessive "son époux" (her spouse). Additionally,
                                        the text says that "Brigitte Macron a toujours été aux côtés
                                        de son époux" (Brigitte Macron has always been by the side
                                        of her spouse) during his political endeavors, which include
                                        the launch of "En Marche !" and the conquest of the Elysée.
                                        Since the reference is to someone who has launched a
                                        political adventure with "En Marche !", which is known to be
                                        initiated by Emmanuel Macron, and who has become the
                                        President of France—as indicated by the term "conquête de
                                        l'Elysée" (conquest of the Elysée)—it can be inferred that
                                        her spouse is Emmanuel Macron. Thus, the provided RDF
                                        triplet ["Emmanuel Macron" - "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"]
                                        is supported by the given information, as the snippet
                                        indirectly states that Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Macron
                                        are married to each other. </modelAnswer>

                                        Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Macron are married. The term
                                        "couple" does suggest a close personal relationship, which
                                        could possibly imply a marital relationship, but in absence
                                        of explicit mention of marriage or them being spouses, we
                                        can not infer the RDF statement ["Emmanuel Macron" -

                                        par l'intéressée encore une fois à Paris Match, en 2016.
                                        Brigitte Macron y décrit la politique comme un monde
                                        "impitoyable", l'obligeant à "faire le maximum pour
                                        protéger" son époux. Ce qui fuite dans la presse dès cette
                                        année là pourtant révèle qu'elle ne compte pas le laisser
                                        seul dans la trajectoire qu'il a choisie. "Il ne fait rien

                                        citait aussi le député Richard Ferrand, devenu le bras droit
                                        puis ministre et président de l'Assemblée par la suite :

                                    <modelAnswer>Yes, the RDF statement ["Emmanuel Macron" -
                                        "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"] can be inferred from the given
                                        snippet. Reasoning: - In the snippet, Brigitte Macron is
                                        described as taking actions to offer "moments de répit" to
                                        Emmanuel Macron, and wanting to protect her "époux" which
                                        translates to "spouse" in English. This establishes a
                                        marital relationship between the two individuals. -
                                        Additionally, the use of phrases such as "faire le maximum
                                        pour protéger son époux" ("doing the maximum to protect her
                                        husband") reinforces the inference that Emmanuel and
                                        Brigitte Macron are married to each other. The information
                                        in the snippet provides enough context to deduce that
                                        Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Macron are spouses, thus

                                        "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"] can be inferred from the given
                                        snippet. Reasoning: The snippet refers to "son couple,"
                                        which translates from French to "her couple" in English when
                                        talking about Brigitte Macron, indicating a romantic
                                        partnership or marriage. Additionally, the snippet includes
                                        both names "Emmanuel" and "Brigitte Macron," which suggests
                                        they are married or at the very least, in a relationship.
                                        Since the context is about their shared private life and the
                                        publication of their vacation photos, it is reasonable to
                                        assume that they are a married couple, which justifies the
                                        "spouse" relationship in the RDF statement. Additionally,
                                        Emmanuel Macron is a well-known public figure, and his
                                        marriage to Brigitte Macron is a matter of public record,
                                        which supports the inference. </modelAnswer>

                                        Macron (due to the use of "couple"), it does not directly

                                        the celebrity press and discusses her role and influence
                                        during Emmanuel Macron's early years as well as mentioning
                                        her discretion before his second presidential campaign.
                                        However, the snippet does not mention anything about
                                        Emmanuel Macron's spouse or personal relationships. Brigitte
                                        Macron, who is actually Emmanuel Macron's spouse, is not
                                        referenced or implied in any way in the text provided.
                                        Therefore, we cannot infer the relationship between Emmanuel
                                        Macron and Brigitte Macron from this snippet. The RDF
                                        statement ["Emmanuel Macron" - "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"]
                                        requires explicit information or a direct reference to their
                                        marital status, which is not present in this snippet. </modelAnswer>

                                        - "Brigitte Macron"] cannot be directly inferred from the
                                        provided snippet. Reasoning: The snippet discusses the role
                                        and framework of the "Première dame" (First Lady) in France
                                        in the context of Emmanuel Macron's presidency. However, it
                                        does not explicitly mention the name of the person who is
                                        the current First Lady nor does it state that Emmanuel
                                        Macron is married to Brigitte Macron. The snippet refers to

                                        while someone familiar with the context might understand
                                        that Brigitte Macron is the First Lady and thus the spouse

                                        the given snippet. The snippet mentions Brigitte Macron's

                                        specifically mention Emmanuel Macron or her marital status.
                                        The snippet indicates that Brigitte Macron has held a public

                                        infer their spousal relationship. First, it notes that
                                        Brigitte Macron consistently presents herself as "une et
                                        indivisible" (one and indivisible) with Emmanuel Macron,
                                        which suggests a close personal bond consistent with a
                                        marital relationship. Furthermore, the snippet mentions that
                                        Brigitte has been playing a role since 2017 as an unofficial
                                        advisor "auprès de son mari" which translates to "beside her
                                        husband," explicitly stating that Emmanuel Macron is her
                                        husband. Therefore, from the use of "son mari" in reference
                                        to her relationship with Emmanuel Macron, one can infer that
                                        Emmanuel Macron's spouse is Brigitte Macron. </modelAnswer>

                                        Instead they have lived as if they are living their

                                        snippet. The RDF statement implies a relationship between
                                        "Emmanuel Macron" and "Brigitte Macron," stating that they

                                        about their relationship. The snippet discusses a

                                        the provided snippet. RDF Statement: ["Emmanuel Macron" -
                                        "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"] The statement is a structured

                                        Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Macron. Snippet Analysis: The
                                        snippet provided discusses a general commentary on the
                                        political and ideological shift in the West around the 1990s
                                        and includes no personal information about Emmanuel Macron,
                                        Brigitte Macron, or any individuals' marital status.
                                        Reasoning: The snippet does not mention Emmanuel Macron,
                                        Brigitte Macron, or any relationships whatsoever. It is a
                                        commentary on the broader sociopolitical climate rather than
                                        specific personal details. Since there is no mention of the
                                        individuals in question or any relationships, the RDF
                                        statement about their spousal connection cannot be inferred
                                        from the snippet. To confirm the RDF statement, you would
                                        need a snippet that specifically mentions Emmanuel Macron as
                                        being married to Brigitte Macron or text that provides clear
                                        evidence of their relationship. </modelAnswer>

                                        snippet. The reason is that the snippet does not mention
                                        Emmanuel Macron, Brigitte Macron, or anything about their
                                        personal relationships. The snippet is instead focused on
                                        the subject of a response by Benjamin Barber to Fukuyama,
                                        which discusses global conflicts and cultural clashes, and
                                        is unrelated to the personal life of Emmanuel Macron. Thus,
                                        the RDF relationship about the marital status of the Macrons

                                        Phillip Longman noted that in France (for example) a tiny

                                    <modelAnswer>No, the given RDF statement cannot be inferred from
                                        the provided snippet. The RDF statement ["Emmanuel Macron" -
                                        "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"] asserts that Emmanuel Macron's

                                        does not mention Emmanuel Macron or Brigitte Macron at all.
                                        The snippet talks about political power, demographics in
                                        France, and the birth rates among practicing Catholics and
                                        immigrant Muslims, without any reference to the personal
                                        relationships or marital status of Emmanuel Macron.
                                        Therefore, the statement cannot be inferred from the given

                    <modelAnswer>Yes, the RDF statement ["Emmanuel Macron" - "spouse" - "Brigitte
                        Macron"] can be inferred from the given snippet.Reasoning:The snippet
                        explicitly mentions "Macron and his wife Brigitte," which directly indicates
                        that Emmanuel Macron is married to a person named Brigitte. Given that there
                        is no additional context suggesting that there is more than one Macron or
                        Brigitte being discussed, we can infer that "Emmanuel Macron" refers to
                        "Macron" and that "his wife Brigitte" refers to "Brigitte Macron." As a
                        result, we can deduce the relationship stated in the RDF triplet that
                        Emmanuel Macron's spouse is Brigitte Macron.</modelAnswer>

                                    <modelAnswer>The given RDF statement is ["Emmanuel Macron" -
                                        "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"]. From the snippet, it can be
                                        inferred that Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron adopted a dog
                                        named Nemo together. The snippet mentions that "il a été
                                        adopté dimanche par Emmanuel et Brigitte Macron", which
                                        translates to "he was adopted on Sunday by Emmanuel and
                                        Brigitte Macron". This suggests that Emmanuel and Brigitte
                                        Macron took a joint action together as a couple. While the
                                        snippet does not directly state that Emmanuel Macron and
                                        Brigitte Macron are spouses, the context of adopting a pet
                                        together typically implies a close relationship, often that
                                        of a married couple or partners. However, the direct
                                        relationship of "spouse" would require more explicit
                                        information to confirm. Based on the snippet alone, there is
                                        a strong implication but not an explicit statement that they
                                        are spouses, so the RDF statement cannot be confirmed solely
                                        on the given information without prior knowledge or an
                                        assumption of their marital status. Therefore, we cannot
                                        infer with absolute certainty that the RDF statement is
                                        accurate based solely on the provided snippet. To infer the
                                        "spouse" relationship explicitly, we would need additional
                                        information that directly states they are married to each
                                        other. </modelAnswer>

                                    <modelAnswer>The RDF statement cannot be directly inferred from
                                        the given snippet. The snippet is from an article where
                                        Natacha Harry, the president of the SPA, is talking about
                                        Brigitte Macron visiting a refuge and mentioning that she
                                        and her husband were looking to adopt a dog. Although it can
                                        be reasonably assumed that "son mari" (her husband) refers
                                        to Emmanuel Macron, considering Brigitte's high-profile
                                        public status, the snippet does not explicitly state that
                                        Emmanuel Macron is the spouse of Brigitte Macron. Since the

                                    <modelAnswer>No, the given RDF statement cannot be inferred from
                                        the given snippet. The RDF statement claims that "Emmanuel

                                        provided text snippet talks about "la première dame" (the
                                        first lady) and her involvement with the SPA (Société

                                        mentioning a dog named Marin and the historical tie to
                                        François Hollande's fief in Tulle, Corrèze. The term "la

                                        talking about the wife of the French president. However, it
                                        does not mention Emmanuel Macron by name, nor does it state
                                        directly that the first lady in question is Brigitte Macron,
                                        Emmanuel Macron's spouse. Without additional information
                                        that establishes the identity of "la première dame" as
                                        Brigitte Macron and her relation to Emmanuel Macron, we

                                    <modelAnswer>Yes, the RDF statement ["Emmanuel Macron" -
                                        "spouse" - "Brigitte Macron"] can be inferred from the given
                                        snippet. Reasoning: The snippet refers to "le couple Macron"
                                        which translates to "the Macron couple", indicating a
                                        marital relationship between two individuals with the
                                        surname Macron. The use of the term "couple" specifically in
                                        the context of a married pair confirms that the individuals
                                        are spouses. Although the snippet does not explicitly
                                        mention the first names of the couple, Emmanuel Macron is
                                        widely known as the President of France and the reference to
                                        "le chef de l'Etat" (the head of state) in the snippet
                                        further confirms that it is Emmanuel Macron who is being
                                        discussed. Given this context and knowing that Emmanuel
                                        Macron's spouse is Brigitte Macron, it can be inferred that
                                        when the snippet refers to "le couple Macron," it means
                                        Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron. Therefore, the RDF statement
                                        that "Emmanuel Macron" has a "spouse" relationship with
                                        "Brigitte Macron" can indeed be inferred from the given

                                        orientation, the region where he was particularly successful
                                        in getting votes, and the fact that he is the youngest
                                        president to be elected in France. However, there is no
                                        mention of his personal life, relationships, or his spouse,
                                        Brigitte Macron. Without direct information about his
                                        marital status or the name of his spouse in the snippet, we
                                        cannot infer the relationship between Emmanuel Macron and
