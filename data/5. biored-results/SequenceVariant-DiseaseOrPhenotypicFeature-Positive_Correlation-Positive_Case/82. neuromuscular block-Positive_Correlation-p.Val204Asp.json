  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"neuromuscular block\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"p.Val204Asp\"]. The snippet mentions \"prolonged neuromuscular block\" and \"p.Val204Asp\" in the same context, suggesting a connection between the two. However, it does not explicitly state a positive correlation between the two. Therefore, the snippet provides some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it cannot be directly verified from the snippet.",
