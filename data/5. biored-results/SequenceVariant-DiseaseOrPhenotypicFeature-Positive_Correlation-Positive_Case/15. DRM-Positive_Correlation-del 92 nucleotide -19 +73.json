The snippet contains direct proof.The RDF statement is [\"DRM\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"del 92 nucleotide -19/+73\"], and the snippet explicitly mentions \"a homozygous SEPN1 deletion (del 92 nucleotide -19/+73) in the affected patients\" in the context of Desmin-related myopathy (DRM). This is a direct match, providing proof for the RDF statement.",
