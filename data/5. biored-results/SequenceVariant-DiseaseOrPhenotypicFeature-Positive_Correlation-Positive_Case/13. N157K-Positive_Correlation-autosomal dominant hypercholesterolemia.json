The snippet mentions \"one patient was a double heterozygote for D374Y and N157K\" and also states that \"Our findings support the notion that mutations in the PCSK9 gene cause autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia.\" This suggests a positive correlation between N157K and autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia, but it does not provide direct proof.",
