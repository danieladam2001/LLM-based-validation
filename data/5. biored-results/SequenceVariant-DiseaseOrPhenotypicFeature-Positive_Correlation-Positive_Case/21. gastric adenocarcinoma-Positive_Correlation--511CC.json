The snippet mentions that \"the proportion of subjects with IL1B-511CC increased according to stage\" and \"subjects with stage IV had a two times higher probability of having either IL1B-511CC genotype compared with stage I subjects\", which suggests a positive correlation between IL1B-511CC and gastric adenocarcinoma.
