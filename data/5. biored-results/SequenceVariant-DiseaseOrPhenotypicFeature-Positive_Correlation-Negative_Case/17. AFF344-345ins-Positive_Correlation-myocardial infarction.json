  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions the mutation \"AFF344-345ins\" in the context of Wolfram syndrome, but it does not explicitly mention \"Positive_Correlation\" or \"myocardial infarction\". While the snippet provides some information about the mutation, it does not provide direct proof of the RDF statement. However, it does contain some indications that the mutation is associated with a disease (Wolfram syndrome), which could be related to the concept of \"Positive_Correlation\" and \"myocardial infarction\", but this connection is not explicitly made in the snippet.",
