In addition, we observed an increased calcium influx in KCl-depolarised cells expressing mutated hippocalcin, mostly driven by N-type voltage-gated calcium channels.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is c) The RDF statement definitely cannot be inferred from the snippet.The RDF statement mentions \"1123T-->G\" which is not present in the given snippet. The snippet talks about different mutations (T71N and A190T) and their effects on hippocalcin, but it does not mention \"1123T-->G\" at all. Therefore, the RDF statement cannot be inferred from the snippet.",
