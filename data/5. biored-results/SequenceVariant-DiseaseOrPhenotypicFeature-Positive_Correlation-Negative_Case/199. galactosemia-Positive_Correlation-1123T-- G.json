Despite the benefit of avoidance of lactose, many patients suffer from long-term complications including neurological deficits and ovarian failure. To date, over 230 mutations have been described in the GALT gene resulting in galactosemia. Recently, an unusual mutation was characterized causing a 5.5 kb deletion, with a relatively high carrier rate in subjects of Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) descent. The aim of this study was to estimate the carrier frequency of this mutation in the AJ population in Israel. For this purpose we developed a high-throughput methodology to genotype both normal and deleted alleles using a chip-based matrix-assisted laser desorption-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer and Multiplex PCR. DNA samples of 760 anonymous AJ subjects were submitted for analysis, subsequently detecting six individuals heterozygous for the GALT deletion mutation, giving a carrier frequency of 1 in 127 (0.79%). Based on these results, we suggest that the method described here provides a basis for genetic screening and prenatal counseling and can potentially reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with delayed diagnosis of galactosemia in this patient population.\n\n\nPlease, choose the correct option based on your answer!\na) The RDF statement can be directly verified from the snippet.

The snippet talks about a 5.5 kb deletion mutation, but it does not mention the specific mutation \"1123T-->G\". Therefore, the RDF statement cannot be inferred from the snippet.",
