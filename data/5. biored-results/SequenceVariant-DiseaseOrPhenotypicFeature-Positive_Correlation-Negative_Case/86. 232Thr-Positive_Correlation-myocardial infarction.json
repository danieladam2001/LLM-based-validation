However, it does mention \"FCGR2B-Ile232Thr\" and its association with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which suggests a positive correlation between the 232Thr variant and a disease (although not myocardial infarction specifically). Therefore, the snippet provides some indication of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not contain direct proof.",
