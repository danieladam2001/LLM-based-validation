Patients with RTH are usually euthyroid but can occasionally present with signs and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis or rarely with hypothyroidism. Affected individuals are usually heterozygous for mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene (TR-beta). We present a patient with RTH found to be homo-/hemizygous for a mutation in the TR-beta gene. The single nucleotide substitution I280S (1123T-->G) was present either on both alleles or in a hemizygous form with complete deletion of the second allele. The I280S mutation was recently reported in a heterozygous patient. The severe phenotype with seriously impaired intellectual development, hyperkinetic behaviour, tachycardia, hearing and visual impairment is probably due to the dominant negative effect of the I280S mutant protein and the absence of any functional TR-beta.\n\n\nPlease, choose the correct option based on your answer!\na) The RDF statement can be directly verified from the snippet.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"RTH\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"G246X\"], but the snippet does not mention \"G246X\" or \"Positive_Correlation\" explicitly. However, it does mention \"RTH\" (Resistance to Thyroid Hormone syndrome) and discusses mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene, which could be related to the RDF statement. Therefore, the snippet provides some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not contain direct proof.",
