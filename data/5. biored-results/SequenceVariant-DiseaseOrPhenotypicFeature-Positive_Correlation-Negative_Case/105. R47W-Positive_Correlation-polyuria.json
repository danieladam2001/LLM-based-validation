There were no mutations detected in the entire coding sequence of MSX1. The C139T mutation, predicted to result in the substitution of an arginine by a tryptophan (R47W) in the N-terminal subdomain, affected conserved residues in the PAX9 paired domain. To elucidate the pathogenic mechanism producing oligodontia phenotype caused by this mutation, we analyzed the binding of wild-type and mutant PAX9 paired domain protein to double-stranded DNA targets.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is a) The RDF statement can be directly verified from the snippet. The snippet contains direct proof.The RDF statement is [\"R47W\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"polyuria\"], and the snippet explicitly mentions the R47W mutation, which is a direct match. However, it's worth noting that the snippet does not mention \"polyuria\" or \"Positive_Correlation\", so the RDF statement is only partially verified.",
