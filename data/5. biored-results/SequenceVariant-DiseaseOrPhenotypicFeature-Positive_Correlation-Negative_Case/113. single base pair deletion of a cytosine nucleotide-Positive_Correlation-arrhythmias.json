The paternal mutation is a G-->A transition located at the 5' donor splice site within intron 51, designated IVS51 + 1G-->A. This mutation leads to the activation of a cryptic splice site, 32 bp downstream of the mutation site and to subsequent aberrant out-of-frame splicing, resulting in two alternative mRNA transcripts and a downstream PTC.
