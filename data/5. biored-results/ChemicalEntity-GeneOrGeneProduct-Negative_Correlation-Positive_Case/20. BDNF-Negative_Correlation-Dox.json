Previous studies have suggested the cardioprotective effect of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). We hypothesize that BDNF could protect against Dox-induced cardiotoxicity.

Protein level of BDNF was reduced in Dox-treated rat ventricles, whereas BDNF and its receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) were markedly up-regulated after BDNF administration.

  "LLM_anwser_parsed": false,
  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"BDNF\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"Dox\"], which implies that BDNF has a negative correlation with Dox. The snippet does not directly state this, but it provides evidence that BDNF has a protective effect against Dox-induced cardiotoxicity, which suggests a negative correlation between the two. The snippet shows that BDNF inhibits Dox-induced cardiac injury, apoptosis, and oxidative stress, and that the beneficial effect of BDNF is abolished by a BDNF scavenger or Akt inhibitor. This provides indirect evidence for the RDF statement, but it does not directly prove it.",
