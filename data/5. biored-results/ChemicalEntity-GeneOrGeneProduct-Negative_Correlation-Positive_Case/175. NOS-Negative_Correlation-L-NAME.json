The administration of L-arginine (600, 800 and 1000 mg/kg, i.p.) in dose-dependent manner significantly increased convulsion incidence and severity and shortened latency time to first convulsion elicited by lower lindane dose (4 mg/kg, i.p.). On the contrary, pretreatment with L-NAME (500, 700 and 900 mg/kg, i.p.) decreased convulsion incidence and severity and prolonged latency time to convulsion following injection with a convulsive dose of lindane (8 mg/kg, i.p.). EEG analyses showed increase of number and duration of ictal periods in EEG of rats receiving l-arginine prior to lindane and decrease of this number in rats pretreated with L-NAME.

The snippet contains direct proof.The RDF statement is [\"NOS\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"L-NAME\"], which can be directly verified from the snippet. The snippet states that L-arginine (precursor of NO synthesis, which is NOS) increases convulsion incidence and severity, while L-NAME (NOS inhibitor) decreases convulsion incidence and severity. This shows a negative correlation between NOS and L-NAME.",
