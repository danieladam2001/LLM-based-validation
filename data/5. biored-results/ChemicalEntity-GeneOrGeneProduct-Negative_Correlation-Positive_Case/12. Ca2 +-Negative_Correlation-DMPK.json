In vitro-differentiated DMPK [-/-] myotubes exhibit a higher resting [Ca2 +] i than do wild-type myotubes because of an altered open probability of voltage-dependent l-type Ca2 + and Na + channels.

  "LLM_anwser_parsed": false,
  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions that DMPK is involved in the modulation of Ca2+ homeostasis, and that the absence of DMPK affects Ca2+ transients and resting [Ca2+]i in skeletal muscle cells. This suggests a negative correlation between Ca2+ and DMPK, but it does not directly state it. Therefore, the RDF statement can be inferred from the snippet, but it requires some interpretation and connection of the dots.",
