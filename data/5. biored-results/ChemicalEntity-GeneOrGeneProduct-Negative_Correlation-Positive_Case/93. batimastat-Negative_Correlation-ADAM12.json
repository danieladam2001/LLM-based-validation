ADAM12 is induced during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a feature associated with claudin-low breast tumors, which are enriched in cancer stem cell (CSC) markers. It is currently unknown whether ADAM12 plays an active role in promoting the CSC phenotype in breast cancer cells. METHODS: ADAM12 expression was downregulated in representative claudin-low breast cancer cell lines, SUM159PT and Hs578T, using siRNA transfection or inducible shRNA expression. Cell characteristics commonly associated with the CSC phenotype in vitro (cell migration, invasion, anoikis resistance, mammosphere formation, ALDH activity, and expression of the CD44 and CD24 cell surface markers) and in vivo (tumor formation in mice using limiting dilution transplantation assays) were evaluated. RNA sequencing was performed to identify global gene expression changes after ADAM12 knockdown. RESULTS: We found that sorted SUM159PT cell populations with high ADAM12 levels had elevated expression of CSC markers and an increased ability to form mammospheres. ADAM12 knockdown reduced cell migration and invasion, decreased anoikis resistance, and compromised mammosphere formation. ADAM12 knockdown also diminished ALDEFLUOR(+) and CD44(hi)/CD24(-/lo) CSC-enriched populations in vitro and reduced tumorigenesis in mice in vivo. RNA sequencing identified a significant overlap between ADAM12- and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-regulated genes. Consequently, ADAM12 knockdown lowered the basal activation level of EGFR, and this effect was abolished by batimastat, a metalloproteinase inhibitor. Furthermore, incubation of cells with exogenously added EGF prevented the downregulation of CD44(hi)/CD24(-/lo) cell population by ADAM12 knockdown. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that ADAM12 actively supports the CSC phenotype in claudin-low breast cancer cells via modulation of the EGFR pathway.\n\n\nPlease, choose the correct option based on your answer!\na) The RDF statement can be directly verified from the snippet.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"batimastat\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"ADAM12\"]. The snippet does not directly state that batimastat has a negative correlation with ADAM12. However, it does mention that batimastat, a metalloproteinase inhibitor, abolished the effect of ADAM12 knockdown on the basal activation level of EGFR. This suggests that batimastat may have an opposing effect on ADAM12, which is an indication of a negative correlation. Therefore, the snippet provides some evidence that supports the RDF statement, but it does not directly prove it.",
