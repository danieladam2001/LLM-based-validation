  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"LDHA\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"FX11\"], which implies that LDHA is negatively correlated with FX11. The snippet does not directly state this correlation, but it does mention that \"inhibition of LDHA activities by FX11\" has certain effects on cancer cells, suggesting that there is a relationship between LDHA and FX11. However, the snippet does not explicitly state the nature of this relationship as a negative correlation. Therefore, the RDF statement cannot be directly verified from the snippet, but the snippet does contain some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.",
