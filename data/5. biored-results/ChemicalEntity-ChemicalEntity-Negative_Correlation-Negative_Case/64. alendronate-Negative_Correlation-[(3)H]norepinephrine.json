  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"alendronate\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"[(3)H]norepinephrine\"], which suggests a negative correlation between alendronate and [(3)H]norepinephrine. The snippet does not directly mention [(3)H]norepinephrine, but it does describe a negative effect of alendronate on the patient's condition, specifically an increase in urinary protein and acute renal failure. This could be seen as an indication of a negative correlation, but it is not a direct proof.",
