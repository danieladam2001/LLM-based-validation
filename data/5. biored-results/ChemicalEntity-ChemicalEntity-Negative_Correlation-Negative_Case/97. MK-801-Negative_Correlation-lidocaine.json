The results showed that intracollicular microinjection of MK-801 and AP7 previous to systemic injections of haloperidol significantly attenuated the catalepsy, as indicated by a reduced latency to step down from a horizontal bar.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"MK-801\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"lidocaine\"], but the snippet does not mention \"lidocaine\" at all. However, it does mention MK-801 as an NMDA receptor antagonist that attenuates haloperidol-induced catalepsy, which suggests a negative correlation between MK-801 and catalepsy. This is an indirect indication of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not provide direct proof.",
