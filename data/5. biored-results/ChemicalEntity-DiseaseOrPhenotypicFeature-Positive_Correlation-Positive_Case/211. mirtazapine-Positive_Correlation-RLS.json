To our knowledge, there is no previous report regarding whether domperidone, a peripheral dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, can also induce or aggravate symptoms of RLS. Mirtazapine, the first noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA), has been associated with RLS in several recent publications. The authors report here a depressed patient comorbid with postprandial dyspepsia who developed RLS after mirtazapine had been added to his domperidone therapy. Our patient started to have symptoms of RLS only after he had been treated with mirtazapine, and his RLS symptoms resolved completely upon discontinuation of his mirtazapine. Such a temporal relationship between the use of mirtazapine and the symptoms of RLS in our patient did not support a potentiating effect of domperione on mirtazapine-associated RLS.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is a) The RDF statement can be directly verified from the snippet. The snippet contains direct proof.The RDF statement is [\"mirtazapine\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"RLS\"], which means that mirtazapine is positively correlated with Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). The snippet explicitly states that \"Mirtazapine... has been associated with RLS in several recent publications\" and provides a specific example of a patient who developed RLS symptoms after taking mirtazapine and had their symptoms resolve after discontinuing it. This direct evidence in the snippet supports the RDF statement.",
