Animals were tested for aggression in their home cage, both with and without physical provocation (mild tail pinch). Brain levels of 5-HT and its metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), were determined using HPLC. PCPA significantly and substantially depleted 5-HT and 5-HIAA in all brain regions examined. Chronic T treatment significantly decreased 5-HT and 5-HIAA in certain brain areas, but to a much lesser extent than PCPA. Chronic exposure to PCPA alone significantly decreased locomotor activity and increased irritability but had no effect on sexual behavior, partner preference, or aggression. T alone had no effect on locomotion, irritability, or sexual behavior but increased partner preference and aggression. The most striking effect of combining T+PCPA was a significant increase in attack frequency as well as a significant decrease in the latency to attack, particularly following physical provocation.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"T\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"aggressive behavior\"], which suggests that testosterone (T) is positively correlated with aggressive behavior. The snippet provides evidence that T alone increased aggression, and the combination of T and PCPA (serotonin depletion) led to a significant increase in attack frequency and a decrease in latency to attack. While the snippet does not directly state that T is positively correlated with aggressive behavior, it provides indications that T is associated with increased aggression, which supports the RDF statement.",
