  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions \"LNNA hypertension\" and \"hypertension\" multiple times, and also discusses the effects of LNNA on blood pressure and vascular function. While it does not explicitly state that LNNA has a positive correlation with hypertension, it provides strong indications of a connection between the two. Therefore, the RDF statement [\"LNNA\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"hypertension\"] can be inferred from the snippet, but it is not directly verified.",
