  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions that domperidone is a peripheral dopamine D2 receptor antagonist and that mirtazapine has been associated with RLS in several recent publications. It also reports a case where a patient developed RLS after taking mirtazapine, but the symptoms resolved upon discontinuation of mirtazapine. While the snippet does not directly state that there is a positive correlation between domperidone and RLS, it provides some evidence that suggests a possible connection between the two. Therefore, the RDF statement [\"RLS\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"domperione\"] can be inferred from the snippet, but it requires some interpretation and connection of the dots.",
