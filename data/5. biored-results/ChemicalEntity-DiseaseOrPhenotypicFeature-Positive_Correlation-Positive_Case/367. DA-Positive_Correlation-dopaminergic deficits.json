The snippet does not directly state that there is a positive correlation between DA and dopaminergic deficits, but it does suggest that DA is not essential for the development of METH-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity, and that mice with unilateral brain DA deficits develop METH-induced dopaminergic deficits of comparable magnitude on both sides of the brain. This implies that there may be a correlation between DA and dopaminergic deficits, but it is not a direct proof.",
