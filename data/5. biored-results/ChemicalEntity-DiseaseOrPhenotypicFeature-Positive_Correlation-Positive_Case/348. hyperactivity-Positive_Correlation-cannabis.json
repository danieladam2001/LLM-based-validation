In both ecstasy and cannabis groups brain activation was decreased in the right medial frontal gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus, left dorsal cingulate gyrus, and left caudate.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"hyperactivity\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"cannabis\"]. The snippet mentions \"parahippocampal hyperactivity\" in cannabis users, which suggests a positive correlation between cannabis use and hyperactivity. However, it does not directly state that cannabis use causes hyperactivity, so the RDF statement cannot be directly verified from the snippet.",
