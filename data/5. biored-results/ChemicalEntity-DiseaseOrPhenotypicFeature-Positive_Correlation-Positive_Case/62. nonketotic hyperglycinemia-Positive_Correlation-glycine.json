  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions \"nonketotic hyperglycinemia\" and \"glycine\" in the context of a disorder of amino acid metabolism, which suggests a connection between the two. However, it does not explicitly state that there is a \"Positive_Correlation\" between them. Therefore, the RDF statement cannot be directly verified from the snippet, but the snippet does provide some indirect evidence that supports the RDF statement.",
