Tenofovir has been implicated in the development of Fanconi syndrome and renal insufficiency because of its effects on the proximal renal tubule.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions that tenofovir may raise the risk of renal failure, which suggests a positive correlation between the two. However, it does not provide direct proof of a positive correlation, as it also mentions the role of vancomycin in renal failure. Therefore, the RDF statement can be inferred from the snippet, but it requires some interpretation and is not directly verified.",
