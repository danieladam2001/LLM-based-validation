Vigabatrin was also used in the treatment of two children. Frequency of absences increased in four children treated with carbamazepine and two of these developed myoclonic jerks, which resolved on withdrawal of carbamazepine.

However, the snippet does provide some information about the relationship between \"absence seizures\" and \"vigabatrin\", which is why option b is the most accurate choice.",
