  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions that \"Massive urinary protein excretion has been observed after conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to mammalian target of rapamycin (mToR) inhibitors, especially sirolimus\", which suggests a correlation between sirolimus and proteinuria. However, it does not directly state that sirolimus causes proteinuria, but rather that it is associated with it. Therefore, the RDF statement [\"proteinuria\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"sirolimus\"] can be inferred from the snippet, but it requires some interpretation and is not directly verified.",
