Haematological toxicity was greater for the combination than AraG alone, although median time to neutrophil and platelet recovery was consistent with other salvage therapies. All patients had some response to the combined therapy and five of the seven went into complete remission after one or two courses of AraG/VP/CPM.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions \"neurological toxicity\" as a side effect of AraG, which is related to the RDF statement [\"AraG\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"neurological toxicity\"]. However, it does not directly state that there is a positive correlation between AraG and neurological toxicity. It only suggests that AraG is associated with neurological toxicity, which is a weaker connection.",
