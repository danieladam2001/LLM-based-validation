  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"cancer\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"Akt\"], but the snippet does not mention \"Akt\" explicitly. However, it does mention \"mTOR signaling\", which is related to the Akt pathway. Additionally, the snippet discusses cancer cells and their metabolic behavior, which could be indirectly related to the RDF statement. Therefore, the snippet provides some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not contain direct proof.",
