  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is a) The RDF statement can be directly verified from the snippet. The snippet contains direct proof.The RDF statement is [\"HEB\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"RORgt\"], which means that HEB has a positive correlation with RORgt. The snippet explicitly states: \"HEB-deficiency also affects mature CD73+ gd T cells, which are defective in RORgt expression...\" This implies that HEB is required for RORgt expression, which is a positive correlation.",
