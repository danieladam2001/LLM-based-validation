  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"GnRH receptor\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"LHbeta\"]. The snippet mentions that \"BMP-4 reduced LHbeta mRNA up-regulation in response to GnRH (+/-activin) and decreased GnRH receptor expression\". This suggests a negative correlation between GnRH receptor and LHbeta, which is opposite to the RDF statement. However, it does not provide direct proof to verify the RDF statement, but rather indicates that the RDF statement might be incorrect.",
