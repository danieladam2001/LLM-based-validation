Double immunofluorescence analysis showed that the number of accumulated F4/80(+) cells expressing TGF-b1 in metastatic areas was higher in WT than in AT1aKO. The AT1aKO bone marrow (BM) (AT1aKO-BM)>WT showed suppressed formation of liver metastasis compared with WT-BM>WT.

In addition, accumulated F4/80(+) cells in the liver metastasis were not BM-derived F4/80(+) cells, but mainly resident hepatic F4/80(+) cells, and these resident hepatic F4/80(+) cells were positive for TGF-b1. Angiotensin II enhanced TGF-b1 expression in Kupffer cells. Treatment of WT with clodronate liposomes suppressed liver metastasis by diminishing TGF-b1(+) F4/80(+) cells accumulation. The formation of liver metastasis correlated with collagen deposition in the metastatic area, which was dependent on AT1a signaling.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"CD31\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"AT1a\"]. The snippet mentions that \"The mRNA levels of CD31... were suppressed in AT1aKO compared with WT.\" This suggests a negative correlation between CD31 and AT1a, rather than a positive correlation. However, it does indicate a relationship between CD31 and AT1a, which is in line with the RDF statement. Therefore, the snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not provide direct proof.",
