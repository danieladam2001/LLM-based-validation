  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"p57Kip2\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"Ras\"]. The snippet mentions that \"cdk inhibitors p27Kip1 and p57Kip2 were upregulated in the Ras transgenic lenses\", which suggests a positive correlation between Ras and p57Kip2. However, it does not directly state that there is a positive correlation between the two, hence option b) is the correct answer.",
