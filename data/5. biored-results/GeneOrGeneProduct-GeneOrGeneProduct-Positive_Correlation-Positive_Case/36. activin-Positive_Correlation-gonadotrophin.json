  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions the interaction between activin and gonadotrophin, and how BMP-4 modulates this interaction. It also mentions the stimulatory effect of activin on FSHbeta promoter-driven transcription. While the snippet does not directly state that there is a positive correlation between activin and gonadotrophin, it provides evidence that suggests a positive relationship between the two. Therefore, the RDF statement can be inferred from the snippet, but it requires some interpretation and connection of the dots.",
