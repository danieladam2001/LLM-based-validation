  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions that \"TGF-beta is known to play a key role in the pathogenesis of [keloid disease]\" and provides information about the effects of TGF-beta on keloid disease, which suggests a positive correlation between TGF-beta and keloid disease. However, it does not directly state that there is a positive correlation between the two. Therefore, the RDF statement can be inferred from the snippet, but it is not directly verified.",
