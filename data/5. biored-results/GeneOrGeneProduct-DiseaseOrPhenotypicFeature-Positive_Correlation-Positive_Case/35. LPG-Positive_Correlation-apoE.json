  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions the association between LPG (Lipoprotein glomerulopathy) and apoE (apolipoprotein E), and also mentions that several gene mutations of apoE have been reported to be associated with LPG. This suggests a positive correlation between LPG and apoE, which is in line with the RDF statement. However, the snippet does not provide direct proof of a positive correlation, but rather provides indications of an association between the two.",
