We tested whether oxidative stress causes ER stress. STUDY DESIGN: Wild-type (WT) and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1)-overexpressing day 8.75 embryos from nondiabetic WT control with SOD1 transgenic male and diabetic WT female with SOD1 transgenic male were analyzed for ER stress markers: C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP), calnexin, eukaryotic initiation factor 2a (eIF2a), protein kinase ribonucleic acid (RNA)-like ER kinase (PERK), binding immunoglobulin protein, protein disulfide isomerase family A member 3, kinases inositol-requiring protein-1a (IRE1a), and the X-box binding protein (XBP1) messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing. RESULTS: Maternal diabetes significantly increased the levels of CHOP, calnexin, phosphorylated (p)-eIF2a, p-PERK, and p-IRE1a; triggered XBP1 mRNA splicing; and enhanced ER chaperone gene expression in WT embryos. SOD1 overexpression blocked these diabetes-induced ER stress markers. CONCLUSION: Mitigating oxidative stress via SOD1 overexpression blocks maternal diabetes-induced ER stress in vivo.\n\n\nPlease, choose the correct option based on your answer!\na) The RDF statement can be directly verified from the snippet.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is a) The RDF statement can be directly verified from the snippet. The snippet contains direct proof.The RDF statement is [\"maternal diabetes\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"CHOP\"], which means that maternal diabetes has a positive correlation with CHOP. The snippet directly states that \"Maternal diabetes significantly increased the levels of CHOP\" in the RESULTS section, which confirms the RDF statement.",
