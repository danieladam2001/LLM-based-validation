The snippet mentions that the polymorphism is \"positively associated with adenocarcinoma, although suggestive associations were also found for squamous- and small-cell lung cancers.\" This indicates a positive correlation between hOGG1 and squamous- and small-cell lung cancers, but it's not a direct proof. The language used is \"suggestive associations\" which implies a weaker connection than a direct correlation.",
