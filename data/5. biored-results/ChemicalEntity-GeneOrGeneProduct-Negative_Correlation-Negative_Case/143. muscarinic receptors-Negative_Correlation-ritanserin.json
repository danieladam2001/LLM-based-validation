  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"muscarinic receptors\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"ritanserin\"]. While the snippet does not directly mention \"ritanserin\" or a \"Negative_Correlation\" between \"muscarinic receptors\" and \"ritanserin\", it does discuss the effects of muscarinic receptor antagonists on urinary strip preparations. The snippet mentions that muscarinic receptor antagonists, such as atropine, 4-DAMP, methoctramine, and pirenzepine, have different effects on the tonic and phasic components of electrical field stimulation-evoked contractile responses in control and inflamed preparations. This suggests that there may be a negative correlation between muscarinic receptors and ritanserin, but it is not directly stated. Therefore, the snippet provides some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not contain direct proof.",
