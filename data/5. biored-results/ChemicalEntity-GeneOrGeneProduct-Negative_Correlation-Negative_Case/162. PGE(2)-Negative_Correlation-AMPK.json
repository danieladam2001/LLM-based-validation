The snippet does not directly mention \"Negative_Correlation\" or \"AMPK\", but it does mention PGE(2) and its involvement in lithium-induced polyuria, which could be interpreted as a negative correlation with AMPK (although this is not explicitly stated). Therefore, the snippet provides some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not contain direct proof.",
