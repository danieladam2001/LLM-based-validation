  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"Bort\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"MM\"], but the snippet does not explicitly mention a negative correlation between Bort and MM. However, it does discuss the effectiveness of Bortezomib (Bort) as a therapy for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM), which could be interpreted as a positive correlation rather than a negative one. Therefore, the snippet provides some indications that are opposite to the RDF statement, but it does not directly prove or disprove the RDF statement.",
