  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions sirolimus, chronic allograft nephropathy, and proteinuria, which are related to the RDF statement. However, it does not directly state that sirolimus has a negative correlation with chronic allograft nephropathy. Instead, it provides context and indirect evidence that suggests a possible connection between the two. Therefore, the RDF statement cannot be directly verified from the snippet, but the snippet does contain some indications of its truthfulness.",
