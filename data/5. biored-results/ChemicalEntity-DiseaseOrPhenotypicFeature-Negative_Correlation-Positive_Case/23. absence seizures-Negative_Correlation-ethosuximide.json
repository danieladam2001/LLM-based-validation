  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions that optimal control of absences was achieved with ethosuximide, which implies a positive correlation between ethosuximide and absence seizures. However, the RDF statement claims a negative correlation between the two. While the snippet does not directly prove the RDF statement, it does provide some indication that the correlation might not be negative, which is why option b is the most suitable answer.",
