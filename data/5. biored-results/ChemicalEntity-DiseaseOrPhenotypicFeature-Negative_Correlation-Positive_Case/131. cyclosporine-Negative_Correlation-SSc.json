  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"cyclosporine\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"SSc\"], which suggests a negative correlation between cyclosporine and SSc. The snippet mentions \"reports of thrombotic microangiopathy precipitated by cyclosporine in patients with SSc\", which implies a negative effect of cyclosporine on SSc patients. While it doesn't directly state a negative correlation, it provides some indication of the truthfulness of the RDF statement.",
