Treatment with antithrombin attenuated the puromycin aminonucleoside-induced hematological abnormalities. Puromycin aminonucleoside-induced renal dysfunction and hyperlipidemia were also suppressed. Histopathological examination revealed severe renal damage such as proteinaceous casts in tubuli and tubular expansion in the kidney of control rats, while an improvement of the damage was seen in antithrombin-treated rats. In addition, antithrombin treatment markedly suppressed puromycin aminonucleoside-induced apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells. Furthermore, puromycin aminonucleoside-induced increases in renal cytokine content were also decreased.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"antithrombin\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"renal damage\"]. The snippet mentions that antithrombin treatment improved renal damage, which suggests a negative correlation between antithrombin and renal damage. However, it does not directly state that there is a negative correlation between the two. Therefore, the RDF statement can be inferred from the snippet, but it requires some interpretation and is not directly verified.",
