Strategies of extended-interval and conventional dosing have been utilized extensively in the general medical population; however, data are lacking to support a dosing strategy in the hematology/oncology population. To evaluate amikacin-associated nephrotoxicity in an adult hematology/oncology population, a prospective, randomized, open-label trial was conducted at a university-affiliated medical center. Forty patients with a diagnosis consistent with a hematologic/oncologic disorder that required treatment with an aminoglycoside were randomized to either conventional or extended-interval amikacin. The occurrence of nephrotoxicity by means of an increase in serum creatinine and evaluation of efficacy via amikacin serum concentrations with respective pathogens were assessed. The occurrence of nephrotoxicity was similar between the conventional and extended-interval groups, at 10% and 5%, respectively (P = 1.00). Six patients in the conventional group had a positive culture, compared with none in the extended-interval group (P = 0.002). The occurrence of nephrotoxicity was similar between the two dosing regimens, but the distribution of risk factors was variable between the two groups.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"hematologic/oncologic disorder\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"aminoglycoside\"]. The snippet provides information about the use of aminoglycoside (amikacin) in patients with hematologic/oncologic disorders, and it mentions that the occurrence of nephrotoxicity was similar between two dosing regimens. This suggests that there might be a negative correlation between hematologic/oncologic disorders and aminoglycoside, but it does not provide direct proof. The snippet provides some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not directly verify it.",
