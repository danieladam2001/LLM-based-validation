Within 14 days of the oral bisphosphonate (alendronate sodium) administration, the amount of daily urinary protein increased rapidly up to 12.8 g with acute renal failure. After discontinuing the oral alendronate, the patient underwent six cycles of hemodialysis and four cycles of LDL apheresis.

  "LLM_anwser_parsed": false,
  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions that the patient was initially responding well to steroid therapy, which implies that steroids have a positive effect on focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The RDF statement claims that there is a negative correlation between steroids and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, which is the opposite of what the snippet suggests. However, the snippet does not provide direct proof of a negative correlation, but rather an indication that steroids may have a positive effect. Therefore, option b is the most accurate answer.",
