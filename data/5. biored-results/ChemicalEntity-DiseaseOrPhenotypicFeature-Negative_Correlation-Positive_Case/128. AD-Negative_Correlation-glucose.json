  "LLM_anwser_parsed": false,
  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"AD\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"glucose\"], which suggests that there is a negative correlation between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and glucose. The snippet provides some indications of this correlation by discussing how dementia in AD is associated with decreased glucose transport and metabolism in brain cells, and how galactose, an alternative source of energy, might be beneficial for cognitive functions in AD. However, the snippet does not provide direct proof of a negative correlation between AD and glucose, hence option b) is the most appropriate answer.",
