  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions \"preterm labor\" and \"corticosteroid\" together, which suggests a connection between the two. Although it doesn't explicitly state a negative correlation, it implies that corticosteroid therapy might be a factor in the complications associated with preterm labor, which is somewhat related to the idea of a negative correlation. However, it's not a direct proof, so option a) is not correct. Option c) is also not correct because the snippet does provide some indication of a connection between the two concepts.",
