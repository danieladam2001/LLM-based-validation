We report a case of 54-year-old woman with medical history of mitral valve prolapse and migraines, who was admitted to the hospital for substernal chest pain and electrocardiogram demonstrated 1/2 mm ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, aVF, V5, and V6 and positive troponin I. Emergent coronary angiogram revealed normal coronary arteries with moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction with wall motion abnormalities consistent with TS. Detailed history obtained retrospectively revealed that the patient took zolmitriptan sparingly only when she had migraines. But before this event, she was taking zolmitriptan 2-3 times daily for several days because of a persistent migraine headache. She otherwise reported that she is quite active, rides horses, and does show jumping without any limitations in her physical activity. There was no evidence of any recent stress or status migrainosus. Extensive literature search revealed multiple cases of coronary artery vasospasm secondary to zolmitriptan, but none of the cases were associated with TS.\n\n\nPlease, choose the correct option based on your answer!\na) The RDF statement can be directly verified from the snippet.

The snippet mentions that the patient took zolmitriptan for migraines, and there was no evidence of status migrainosus. This suggests a negative correlation between zolmitriptan and status migrainosus, but it does not provide direct proof.",
