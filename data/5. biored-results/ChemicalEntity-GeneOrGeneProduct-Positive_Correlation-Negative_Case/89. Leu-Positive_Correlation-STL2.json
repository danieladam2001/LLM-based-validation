However, the snippet does mention the effects of Leu (leucine) on muscle protein synthesis and mTOR activation, which could be interpreted as a positive correlation between Leu and STL2 (although STL2 is not explicitly mentioned). Therefore, the snippet provides some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not contain direct proof.",
