However, it does mention that overload increases GLUT10 protein levels twofold to fivefold, which suggests a positive correlation between GLUT10 and some factor (although it's not mangiferin). Therefore, the snippet provides some indication of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it's not a direct proof.",
