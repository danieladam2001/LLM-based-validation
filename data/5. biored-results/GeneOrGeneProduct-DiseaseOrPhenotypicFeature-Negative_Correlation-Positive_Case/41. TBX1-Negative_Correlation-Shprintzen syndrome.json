We report a novel heterozygous missense mutation, H194Q, in a familial case of Shprintzen syndrome and show that this and the two previously reported missense mutations result in gain of function, possibly through stabilization of the protein dimer DNA complex.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"TBX1\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"Shprintzen syndrome\"], but the snippet does not directly mention a \"Negative_Correlation\" between TBX1 and Shprintzen syndrome. However, it does mention that TBX1 mutations can result in Shprintzen syndrome, which could be interpreted as a negative correlation. Therefore, the snippet provides some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not contain direct proof.",
