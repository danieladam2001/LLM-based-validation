  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"CB\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"AD\"], which suggests a negative correlation between Calbindin-D28k (CB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The snippet provides evidence that the removal of CB from amyloid precursor protein/presenilin transgenic mice aggravates AD pathogenesis, which implies a negative correlation between CB and AD. However, the snippet does not directly state that CB has a negative correlation with AD, but rather provides experimental evidence that suggests this correlation. Therefore, the RDF statement can be inferred from the snippet, but it requires some interpretation and connection of the dots.",
