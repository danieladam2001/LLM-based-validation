  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions \"Rab6a-GTP\" and its effect on BICD2, which is related to the RDF statement [\"Rab6a-GTP\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"PKCalpha\"]. However, the snippet does not directly mention PKCalpha or a positive correlation between Rab6a-GTP and PKCalpha. Therefore, the RDF statement cannot be directly verified from the snippet, but the snippet provides some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.",
