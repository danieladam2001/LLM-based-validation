  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"NRG-1 alpha\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"Iba1\"]. However, the snippet does not mention \"Iba1\" at all. It does mention NRG-1 alpha and its effects on MPNST cells, but it does not provide a direct correlation with Iba1. Therefore, the RDF statement cannot be directly verified from the snippet, but the snippet does provide some information about NRG-1 alpha that could be relevant to the RDF statement.",
