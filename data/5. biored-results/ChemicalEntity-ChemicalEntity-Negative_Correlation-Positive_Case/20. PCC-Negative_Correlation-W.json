  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"PCC\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"W\"], which suggests that PCC has a negative correlation with W (Warfarin-associated intracerebral hemorrhage).The snippet provides evidence that PCC reduces hemorrhagic blood volume in a mouse model of W-ICH, which implies a negative correlation between PCC and W. However, the snippet does not directly state that PCC has a negative correlation with W, but rather provides experimental data that suggests this correlation. Therefore, the RDF statement can be inferred from the snippet, but it requires some interpretation and connection of the dots.",
