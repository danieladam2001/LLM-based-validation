Antithrombin (50 or 500 IU/kg/i.v.) was administered to rats once a day for 10 days immediately after the injection of puromycin aminonucleoside (50 mg/kg/i.v.). Treatment with antithrombin attenuated the puromycin aminonucleoside-induced hematological abnormalities. Puromycin aminonucleoside-induced renal dysfunction and hyperlipidemia were also suppressed. Histopathological examination revealed severe renal damage such as proteinaceous casts in tubuli and tubular expansion in the kidney of control rats, while an improvement of the damage was seen in antithrombin-treated rats. In addition, antithrombin treatment markedly suppressed puromycin aminonucleoside-induced apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells. Furthermore, puromycin aminonucleoside-induced increases in renal cytokine content were also decreased. These findings suggest that thrombin plays an important role in the pathogenesis of puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrotic syndrome.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement claims a negative correlation between \"antithrombin\" and \"puromycin aminonucleoside\", which means that antithrombin has a protective or inhibitory effect on puromycin aminonucleoside. The snippet provides evidence that antithrombin treatment attenuates the effects of puromycin aminonucleoside, such as hematological abnormalities, renal dysfunction, and hyperlipidemia, and also suppresses apoptosis and cytokine content. While the snippet does not directly state a negative correlation, it provides indications that antithrombin has a beneficial effect in counteracting the negative effects of puromycin aminonucleoside, which supports the RDF statement.",
