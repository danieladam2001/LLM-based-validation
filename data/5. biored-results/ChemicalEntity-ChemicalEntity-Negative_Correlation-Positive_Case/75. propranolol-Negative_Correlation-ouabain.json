  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"propranolol\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"ouabain\"]. The snippet mentions that both isomers of propranolol were capable of reversing ventricular tachycardia caused by ouabain in anaesthetized cats and dogs (point 7). This suggests a negative correlation between propranolol and ouabain, as propranolol is able to reverse the effects of ouabain. However, the snippet does not directly state a negative correlation between the two, so option a) is not correct. Option c) is also incorrect because the snippet does provide some indication of the truthfulness of the RDF statement.",
