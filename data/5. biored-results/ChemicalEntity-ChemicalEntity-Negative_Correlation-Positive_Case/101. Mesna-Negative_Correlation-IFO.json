  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"Mesna\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"IFO\"], which implies that Mesna has a negative correlation with IFO. The snippet provides evidence that Mesna reduces the genotoxicity of IFO and also reduces the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges when administered with IFO. Additionally, it mentions that Mesna acts in an inhibitory fashion on the cytostatic action of IFO when administered in high concentrations. These statements in the snippet suggest a negative correlation between Mesna and IFO, but they do not directly prove the RDF statement. Therefore, option b) is the correct answer.",
