  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement [\"pilocarpine\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"aconitine\"] suggests a negative correlation between pilocarpine and aconitine. The snippet provides evidence that pilocarpine has antiarrhythmic effects and reduces the overload of calcium ions induced by aconitine, which implies a negative correlation between the two. However, the snippet does not directly state a negative correlation, but rather provides indirect evidence that supports this claim.",
