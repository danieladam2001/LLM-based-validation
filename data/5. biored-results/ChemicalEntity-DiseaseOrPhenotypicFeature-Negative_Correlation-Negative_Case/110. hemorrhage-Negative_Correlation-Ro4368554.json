  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"hemorrhage\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"Ro4368554\"]. While the snippet does not directly mention \"Ro4368554\", it does discuss the reduction of hemorrhage volume in a mouse model of warfarin-associated intracerebral hemorrhage when treated with human prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC). The snippet shows a negative correlation between PCC treatment and hemorrhage volume, which is similar to the RDF statement. However, it does not provide direct proof, as the RDF statement is not explicitly mentioned in the snippet.",
