  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions that the patient was initially responding well to steroid therapy, and then the patient's condition worsened after taking alendronate, leading to acute renal failure and increased proteinuria. This suggests that steroids may have a positive effect, and alendronate may have a negative effect, which is related to the concept of atrophy. However, the snippet does not directly state that steroids have a negative correlation with atrophy. Therefore, the RDF statement cannot be directly verified from the snippet, but the snippet provides some indications of its truthfulness.",
