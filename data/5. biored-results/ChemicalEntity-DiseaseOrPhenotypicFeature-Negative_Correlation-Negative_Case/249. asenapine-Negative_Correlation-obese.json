  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is c) The RDF statement definitely cannot be inferred from the snippet.The RDF statement claims a negative correlation between asenapine and obese, but the snippet does not mention anything about obesity or weight gain as a result of taking asenapine. In fact, it states that \"no more than 5% of patients had clinically significant weight change\" across all groups, which suggests that asenapine does not have a significant impact on weight. Therefore, the RDF statement cannot be inferred from the snippet.",
