  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is c) The RDF statement definitely cannot be inferred from the snippet.The RDF statement claims a negative correlation between \"gastric lymphoma\" and \"ISPH\", but the snippet does not mention ISPH at all. It discusses the association between gastric lymphoma and atrial fibrillation, as well as the cardiac toxicity of chemotherapy, but it does not provide any information about ISPH. Therefore, it is not possible to infer the RDF statement from the snippet.",
