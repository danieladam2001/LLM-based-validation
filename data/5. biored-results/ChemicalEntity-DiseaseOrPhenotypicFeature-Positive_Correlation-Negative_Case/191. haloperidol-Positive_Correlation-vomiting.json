  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions \"haloperidol-induced catalepsy\" which implies that haloperidol is associated with some negative effect (catalepsy). Although it does not explicitly state that haloperidol is positively correlated with vomiting, it suggests that haloperidol has some adverse effects, which could be related to vomiting. Therefore, the snippet provides some indication of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not contain direct proof.",
