  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions doxorubicin-based chemotherapy, but it does not directly mention \"fulminant hepatic failure\" or a \"Positive_Correlation\" between the two. However, it does mention cardiac toxicity associated with doxorubicin-based chemotherapy, which could be related to hepatic failure. Therefore, the snippet provides some indirect indication of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not contain direct proof.",
