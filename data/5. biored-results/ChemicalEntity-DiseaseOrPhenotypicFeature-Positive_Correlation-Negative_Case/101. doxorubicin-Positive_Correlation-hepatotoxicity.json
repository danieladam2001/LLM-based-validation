  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions \"cardiac toxicity\" associated with doxorubicin-based chemotherapy, which is related to hepatotoxicity (liver damage). Although it doesn't directly state \"hepatotoxicity\", it provides an indication of the potential toxicity of doxorubicin, which supports the RDF statement. However, it's not a direct proof, hence option b) is the most suitable answer.",
