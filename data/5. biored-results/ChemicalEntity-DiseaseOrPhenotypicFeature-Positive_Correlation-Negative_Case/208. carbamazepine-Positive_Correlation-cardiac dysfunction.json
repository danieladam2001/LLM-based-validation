  "LLM_anwser_parsed": false,
  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions \"cardiovascular system\" as one of the systems affected by carbamazepine, and also specifically mentions \"myocarditis\" (inflammation of the heart muscle) as a side effect of carbamazepine, which led to \"cardiogenic shock\" and death. This suggests a positive correlation between carbamazepine and cardiac dysfunction, but it does not directly state it. Therefore, the RDF statement can be inferred from the snippet, but it requires some interpretation and connection of the mentioned concepts.",
