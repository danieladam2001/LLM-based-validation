  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions \"catecholamines\" and \"excess\" which could be related to obesity (obese), but it does not directly state a positive correlation between the two. However, it does provide some indirect evidence that catecholamines can have negative effects on the heart, which could be related to obesity. Therefore, the snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not provide direct proof.",
