  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet does not directly mention \"postoperative nausea and vomiting\" which is part of the RDF, but it does mention adverse reactions to carbamazepine, including cardiovascular system effects, which could be related to nausea and vomiting. Therefore, the snippet provides some indirect indications that support the RDF, but it does not provide direct proof.",
