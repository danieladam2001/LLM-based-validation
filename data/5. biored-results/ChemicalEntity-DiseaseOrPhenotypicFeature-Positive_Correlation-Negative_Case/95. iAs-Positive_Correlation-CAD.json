  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions \"inorganic arsenic (iAs)\" and \"cancer development\", which are related to the RDF statement [\"iAs\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"CAD\"]. Although the snippet does not directly state a positive correlation between iAs and CAD (coronary artery disease), it does suggest a link between early-life iAs exposure and cancer development, which is a related concept. Therefore, the snippet provides some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF statement, but it does not provide direct proof.",
