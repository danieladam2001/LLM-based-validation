  "LLM_anwser_parsed": false,
  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions that streptozotocin treatment raises plasma ghrelin levels, which suggests a positive correlation between streptozotocin and ghrelin. However, it does not directly state that there is a positive correlation between the two. Therefore, the RDF statement can be inferred from the snippet, but it requires some interpretation and connection of the dots.",
