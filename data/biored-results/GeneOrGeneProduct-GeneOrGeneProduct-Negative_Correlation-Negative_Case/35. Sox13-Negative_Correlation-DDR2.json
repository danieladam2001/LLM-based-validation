HEB-deficiency also affects mature CD73+ gd T cells, which are defective in RORgt expression and IL-17 production. Additionally, the fetal TCRg chain repertoire is altered, and peripheral Vg4 gd T cells are mostly restricted to the IFNg-producing phenotype in HEB-deficient mice.

However, it does provide some context about the role of Sox13 in the development of gdT17 cells, which could be related to DDR2. Therefore, the snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not provide direct proof.",
