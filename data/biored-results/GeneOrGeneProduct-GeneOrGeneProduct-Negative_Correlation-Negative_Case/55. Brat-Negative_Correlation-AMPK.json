Although the snippet doesn't explicitly mention \"AMPK\", it does discuss the role of \"Brat\" in regulating cell differentiation and responsiveness to Dpp signaling. This could be interpreted as a negative correlation, but it's not a direct proof. The snippet provides some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it's not a definitive verification.",
