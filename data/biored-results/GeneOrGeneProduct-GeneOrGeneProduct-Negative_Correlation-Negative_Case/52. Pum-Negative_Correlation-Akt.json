  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"Pum\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"Akt\"], but the snippet does not mention \"Akt\" at all. However, it does mention Pum and its role in regulating targets, including Mad and dMyc mRNAs, which could be related to a negative correlation. Therefore, the snippet provides some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not contain direct proof.",
