  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"VPAC2 receptor\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"DDR2\"]. However, the snippet does not mention DDR2 at all. It does mention the VPAC2 receptor and its role in reducing inflammation and promoting the expansion and maintenance of the Treg pool, which could be interpreted as a negative correlation with autoimmune diseases or inflammation. However, the connection to DDR2 is not present in the snippet, so the RDF statement cannot be directly verified.",
