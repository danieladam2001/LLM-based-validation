However, the role of TD-induced HIF-1a in neurological injury is currently unknown. Using Western blot analysis and RT-PCR, we have demonstrated that TD induces HIF-1a expression and activity in primary mouse astrocytes. We observed a time-dependent increase in mRNA and protein expression of the pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory HIF-1a target genes MCP1, BNIP3, Nix and Noxa during TD. We also observed apoptotic cell death in TD as demonstrated by PI/Annexin V staining, TUNEL assay, and Cell Death ELISA. Pharmacological inhibition of HIF-1a activity using YC1 and thiamine repletion both reduced expression of pro-apoptotic HIF-1a target genes and apoptotic cell death in TD.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"HIF-1a\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"HEB\"], but the snippet does not directly mention \"Negative_Correlation\" or \"HEB\". However, it does mention that HIF-1a is activated during thiamine deficiency and leads to pro-apoptotic responses, which could be interpreted as a negative correlation with HEB (astrocyte cell survival or health). Therefore, the snippet provides some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not directly verify it.",
