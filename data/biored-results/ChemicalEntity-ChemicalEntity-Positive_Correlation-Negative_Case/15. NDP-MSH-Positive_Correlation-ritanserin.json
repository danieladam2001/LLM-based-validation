  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"NDP-MSH\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"ritanserin\"], but the snippet does not mention \"ritanserin\" at all. However, it does mention the positive effects of NDP-MSH on insulin signaling, which could be interpreted as a positive correlation. Therefore, the snippet provides some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not contain direct proof.",
