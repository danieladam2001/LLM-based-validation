IFO and Mesna were administrated separately on rabbit's lymphocytes in vivo, which were later developed in vitro.

Mesna's action, in conjunction with IFO reduces the frequency of SCEs, in comparison with the SCEs recordings obtained when IFO is administered alone. In addition to this, when high concentrations of Mesna were administered alone significant reductions of the PRI were noted, than with IFO acting at the same concentration on the lymphocytes. Mesna significantly reduces IFO's genotoxicity, while when administered in high concentrations it acts in an inhibitory fashion on the cytostatic action of the drug.\n\n\nPlease, choose the correct option based on your answer!\na) The RDF statement can be directly verified from the snippet.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"IFO\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"hemorrhagic\"]. The snippet mentions that IFO (ifosfamide) is characterized by its intense urotoxic action, leading to hemorrhagic cystitis. This implies a positive correlation between IFO and hemorrhagic effects, but it does not directly state it. Therefore, the snippet provides some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not contain direct proof.",
