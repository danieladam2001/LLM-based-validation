We report a case of 54-year-old woman with medical history of mitral valve prolapse and migraines, who was admitted to the hospital for substernal chest pain and electrocardiogram demonstrated 1/2 mm ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, aVF, V5, and V6 and positive troponin I. Emergent coronary angiogram revealed normal coronary arteries with moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction with wall motion abnormalities consistent with TS. Detailed history obtained retrospectively revealed that the patient took zolmitriptan sparingly only when she had migraines. But before this event, she was taking zolmitriptan 2-3 times daily for several days because of a persistent migraine headache. She otherwise reported that she is quite active, rides horses, and does show jumping without any limitations in her physical activity.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions \"coronary artery vasospasm secondary to Zolmitriptan\", which suggests a positive correlation between zolmitriptan and coronary artery vasospasm. Although it does not directly state \"coronary artery vasospasm\" is positively correlated with \"zolmitriptan\", the context implies a connection between the two. Therefore, the snippet provides some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not contain direct proof.",
