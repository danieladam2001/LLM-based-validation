It evokes convulsions mainly trough the blockage of GABA(A) receptors.

The aim of the current study was to determine the effects of NO on the behavioral and EEG characteristics of lindane-induced epilepsy in male Wistar albino rats. The administration of L-arginine (600, 800 and 1000 mg/kg, i.p.) in dose-dependent manner significantly increased convulsion incidence and severity and shortened latency time to first convulsion elicited by lower lindane dose (4 mg/kg, i.p.). On the contrary, pretreatment with L-NAME (500, 700 and 900 mg/kg, i.p.) decreased convulsion incidence and severity and prolonged latency time to convulsion following injection with a convulsive dose of lindane (8 mg/kg, i.p.). EEG analyses showed increase of number and duration of ictal periods in EEG of rats receiving l-arginine prior to lindane and decrease of this number in rats pretreated with L-NAME.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is a) The RDF statement can be directly verified from the snippet. The snippet contains direct proof.The RDF statement is [\"l-arginine\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"seizures\"], which means that l-arginine has a positive correlation with seizures. The snippet explicitly states that \"The administration of L-arginine... significantly increased convulsion incidence and severity\", which directly supports the RDF statement.",
