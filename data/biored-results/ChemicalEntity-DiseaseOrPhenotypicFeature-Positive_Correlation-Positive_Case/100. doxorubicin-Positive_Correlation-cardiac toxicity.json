  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions \"cardiac toxicity\" and \"doxorubicin-based chemotherapy\", which are related to the RDF statement [\"doxorubicin\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"cardiac toxicity\"]. However, it does not directly state that doxorubicin is positively correlated with cardiac toxicity. Instead, it suggests that the cardiac toxicity associated with doxorubicin-based chemotherapy could be a triggering factor for atrial fibrillation in a patient with a predisposed myocardium. Therefore, the snippet provides some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF statement, but it does not contain direct proof.",
