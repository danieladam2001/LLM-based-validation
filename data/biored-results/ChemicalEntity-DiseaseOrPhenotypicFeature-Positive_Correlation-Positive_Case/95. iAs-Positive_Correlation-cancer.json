  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions that \"early-life iAs exposure\" is associated with \"the development of these latent diseases, particularly in relationship to cancer\", which suggests a positive correlation between iAs and cancer. However, it does not directly state that iAs has a positive correlation with cancer, but rather implies it through the discussion of the mechanisms underlying the increased risk of cancer development. Therefore, the RDF statement can be inferred from the snippet, but it requires some interpretation and connection of the ideas presented.",
