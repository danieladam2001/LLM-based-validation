  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions that sevoflurane reduces the convulsive effect of lidocaine toxicity, which implies a positive correlation between lidocaine and convulsive effects. However, it does not directly state that there is a positive correlation between lidocaine and convulsive effects. Therefore, the RDF statement can be inferred from the snippet, but it requires some interpretation and is not directly verified.",
