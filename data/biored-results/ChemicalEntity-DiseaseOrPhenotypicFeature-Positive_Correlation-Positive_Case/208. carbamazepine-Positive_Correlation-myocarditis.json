We report a case of hypersensitivity myocarditis secondary to administration of carbamazepine. Acute hypersensitivity myocarditis was not suspected clinically, and the diagnosis was made post-mortem. Histology revealed diffuse infiltration of the myocardium by eosinophils and lymphocytes with myocyte damage. Clinically, death was due to cardiogenic shock.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is a) The RDF statement can be directly verified from the snippet. The snippet contains direct proof.The snippet explicitly mentions \"carbamazepine\" and \"myocarditis\" together, indicating a positive correlation between the two. The text states \"a case of hypersensitivity myocarditis secondary to administration of carbamazepine\" and \"fatal carbamazepine induced myocarditis\", which directly supports the RDF statement [\"carbamazepine\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"myocarditis\"].",
