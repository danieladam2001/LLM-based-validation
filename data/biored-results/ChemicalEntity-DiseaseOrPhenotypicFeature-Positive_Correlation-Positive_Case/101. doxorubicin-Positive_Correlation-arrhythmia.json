  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions \"atrial fibrillation\" (a type of arrhythmia) and \"doxorubicin-based chemotherapy\", which are related to the RDF statement [\"doxorubicin\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"arrhythmia\"]. However, it does not directly state that doxorubicin causes arrhythmia, but rather suggests that the cardiac toxicity of the chemotherapy could be a triggering factor for the arrhythmia in a predisposed patient. Therefore, the snippet provides some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF, but does not directly verify it.",
