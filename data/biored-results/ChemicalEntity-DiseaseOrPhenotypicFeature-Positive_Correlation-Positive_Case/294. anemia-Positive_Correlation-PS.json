According to annexin V binding, erythrocytes from patients indeed showed a significant increase of PS exposure within 1 week of treatment with azathioprine. In a second series, cytosolic Ca2+ activity (Fluo3 fluorescence), cell volume (forward scatter), and PS-exposure (annexin V binding) were determined by FACS analysis in erythrocytes from healthy volunteers. RESULTS: Exposure to azathioprine (> or =2 microg/mL) for 48 hours increased cytosolic Ca2+ activity and annexin V binding and decreased forward scatter.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is a) The RDF statement can be directly verified from the snippet. The snippet contains direct proof.The RDF statement is [\"anemia\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"PS\"], which means that anemia is positively correlated with PS (phosphatidylserine). The snippet explicitly states that anemia could result from accelerated suicidal erythrocyte death or eryptosis, which is characterized by exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) at the erythrocyte surface. Additionally, the results of the experiments described in the snippet show that azathioprine triggers suicidal erythrocyte death, which contributes to azathioprine-induced anemia, and that this effect is associated with increased PS exposure. Therefore, the snippet provides direct proof of the RDF statement.",
