The administration of L-arginine (600, 800 and 1000 mg/kg, i.p.) in dose-dependent manner significantly increased convulsion incidence and severity and shortened latency time to first convulsion elicited by lower lindane dose (4 mg/kg, i.p.). On the contrary, pretreatment with L-NAME (500, 700 and 900 mg/kg, i.p.) decreased convulsion incidence and severity and prolonged latency time to convulsion following injection with a convulsive dose of lindane (8 mg/kg, i.p.).

The snippet does not directly state that NO has a positive correlation with seizures, but it does suggest that NO plays a role in increasing convulsion incidence and severity, and shortening latency time to first convulsion, which implies a positive correlation. Therefore, the snippet provides some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not contain direct proof.",
