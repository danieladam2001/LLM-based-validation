  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions that diabetes can be induced in rats challenged with the viral mimetic poly I:C, which suggests a positive correlation between poly I:C and diabetes. However, it does not directly state that there is a positive correlation between the two. Therefore, the RDF statement cannot be directly verified from the snippet, but the snippet does provide some indication of the truthfulness of the RDF.",
