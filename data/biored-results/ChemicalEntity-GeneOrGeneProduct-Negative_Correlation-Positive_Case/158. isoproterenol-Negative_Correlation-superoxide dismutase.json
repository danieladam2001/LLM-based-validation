  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"isoproterenol\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"superoxide dismutase\"]. The snippet mentions that isoproterenol-treated rats showed significant decreases in the activities of superoxide dismutase, which suggests a negative correlation between isoproterenol and superoxide dismutase. However, the snippet does not directly state that there is a negative correlation between the two, but rather provides evidence that suggests such a correlation. Therefore, the RDF statement can be inferred from the snippet, but it is not directly verified.",
