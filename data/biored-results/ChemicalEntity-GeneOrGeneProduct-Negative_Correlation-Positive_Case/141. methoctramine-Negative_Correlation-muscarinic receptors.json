In inflamed preparations, the muscarinic receptor antagonism on the phasic component of the electrical field stimulation-evoked contraction was decreased and the pirenzepine and 4-DAMP antagonism on the tonic component was much less efficient than in controls. In contrast to controls, methoctramine increased -- instead of decreased -- the tonic responses at high frequencies.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"methoctramine\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"muscarinic receptors\"]. The snippet mentions methoctramine as a muscarinic receptor antagonist, and it also mentions that methoctramine increased the tonic responses at high frequencies in inflamed preparations, which is an unusual effect compared to controls. This suggests a negative correlation between methoctramine and muscarinic receptors, but it's not a direct proof. The snippet provides some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it's not a direct verification.",
