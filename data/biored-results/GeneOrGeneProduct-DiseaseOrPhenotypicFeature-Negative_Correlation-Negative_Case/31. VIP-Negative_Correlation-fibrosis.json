  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"VIP\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"fibrosis\"]. While the snippet does not directly mention \"fibrosis\", it does discuss the role of VIP in autoimmune disease and its anti-inflammatory actions. Additionally, it mentions the exacerbation of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in VIPR2-deficient mice, which could be related to fibrosis. However, the connection is not direct, and more information would be needed to confirm the RDF statement.",
