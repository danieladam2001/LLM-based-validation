In Southern blot analysis, from the signal densities of the hybridized bands and their similarities to those of exons 2 and 3 in our previous quantitative study, we found that exon 1beta was homozygously deleted in four cases, hemizygously deleted in five cases and not deleted in one case. Thus, the same deletion patterns covered the entire p14 gene for all cases except for one case, which suggested the hemizygous deletion of exons 1beta and 2 and homozygous deletion of exon 3. In addition, although exon 1beta mutation is rare in various tumors, we detected a missense mutation (L50R) in one case with a hemizygous deletion. Methylation of the 5'CpG island of the p14 gene was not suggested for any case without homozygous deletion. Our observation of frequent p14 gene abnormalities (90%) and inactivation (40-60%) was in striking contrast to the same pathological subtype of systemic lymphoma in which p14 gene abnormalities and inactivation were infrequent, suggesting a difference in carcinogenesis between PCNSL and systemic lymphoma.\n\n\nPlease, choose the correct option based on your answer!\na) The RDF statement can be directly verified from the snippet.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"p14\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"fulminant hepatic failure\"]. However, the snippet does not mention \"fulminant hepatic failure\" at all. It talks about primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSL, brain lymphomas) and p14 gene abnormalities and inactivation.Although the snippet does not provide direct proof of the RDF statement, it does mention p14 gene abnormalities and inactivation, which could be related to a negative correlation with certain diseases or conditions, including fulminant hepatic failure. Therefore, the snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not provide direct verification.",
