  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is c) The RDF statement definitely cannot be inferred from the snippet.The RDF statement claims that \"PGC-1a\" has a \"Negative_Correlation\" with \"arrhythmias\". However, the snippet does not mention \"arrhythmias\" at all. It discusses the role of PGC-1a in podocyte energy metabolism and diabetic nephropathy, but it does not provide any information about its correlation with arrhythmias. Therefore, the RDF statement cannot be inferred from the snippet.",
