PAK2 was activated by some pancreatic growth-factors [EGF, PDGF, bFGF], by secretagogues activating phospholipase-C (PLC) [CCK, carbachol, bombesin] and by post-receptor stimulants activating PKC [TPA], but not agents only mobilizing cellular calcium or increasing cyclic AMP.

CCK-activation of PAK2 showed several novel features being dependent on both receptor-activation states, having PLC- and PKC-dependent/independent components and small-GTPase-dependent/independent components.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is a) The RDF statement can be directly verified from the snippet. The snippet contains direct proof.The RDF statement is [\"PAK2\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"bFGF\"], which means that PAK2 is positively correlated with bFGF. The snippet explicitly states that \"PAK2 was activated by some pancreatic growth-factors [EGF, PDGF, bFGF]\", which directly verifies the RDF statement.",
