  "LLM_anwser_parsed": false,
  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions \"Rab6a-GTP\" and \"DDB\" in the same context, and describes how Rab6a-GTP affects the behavior of DDB. This suggests a positive correlation between Rab6a-GTP and DDB, which is consistent with the RDF statement. However, the snippet does not directly state that Rab6a-GTP has a positive correlation with DDB, so option a) is not correct.",
