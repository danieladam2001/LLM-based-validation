In this study, we performed a two-stage case-control association study for irinotecan-induced severe myelosuppression (grades 3 and 4). In the first stage, 23 patients who developed severe myelosuppression and 58 patients who did not develop any toxicity were examined for 170 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 14 genes involved in the metabolism and transport of irinotecan. A total of five SNPs were identified to show the possible association with severe myelosuppression (P(Fisher)<0.01) and were further examined in 7 cases and 20 controls in the second stage of the study. An intronic SNP, rs2622604, in ABCG2 showed P(Fisher)=0.0419 in the second stage and indicated a significant association with severe myelosuppression in the combined study (P(Fisher)=0.000237; P(Corrected)=0.036).

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"rs2622604\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"irinotecan\"], which suggests a positive correlation between the SNP rs2622604 and irinotecan. The snippet does not directly state this correlation, but it does mention that the SNP rs2622604 is associated with irinotecan-induced severe myelosuppression, which implies a positive correlation. Therefore, the snippet provides some indication of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not directly prove it.",
