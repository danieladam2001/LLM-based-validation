DESIGN: A retrospective observational cohort study. SETTING: A major healthcare network involving four tertiary hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred thirty-five patients aged 76 and older admitted to a major healthcare network between July 1, 2001, and June 30, 2002, with atrial fibrillation on warfarin were enrolled. MEASUREMENTS: Information regarding major bleeding episodes, strokes, and warfarin use was obtained from patients, relatives, primary physicians, and medical records. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-eight patients (42% men) with a mean age of 81.1 (range 76-94) were included in the analysis. Total follow-up on warfarin was 530 years (mean 28 months). There were 53 major hemorrhages, for an annual rate of 10.0%, including 24 (45.3%) life-threatening and five (9.4%) fatal bleeds. The annual stroke rate after initiation of warfarin was 2.6%.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"stroke\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"Ro4368554\"], which suggests a negative correlation between stroke and Ro4368554. The snippet does not directly mention Ro4368554, but it does mention that the annual stroke rate after initiation of warfarin was 2.6%, which is a relatively low rate. This could be interpreted as an indication of a negative correlation between stroke and warfarin, which might be related to Ro4368554 (although this is not explicitly stated). Therefore, the snippet provides some indirect evidence that supports the RDF statement, but it does not provide direct proof.",
