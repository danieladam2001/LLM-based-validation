We report a case of 54-year-old woman with medical history of mitral valve prolapse and migraines, who was admitted to the hospital for substernal chest pain and electrocardiogram demonstrated 1/2 mm ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, aVF, V5, and V6 and positive troponin I. Emergent coronary angiogram revealed normal coronary arteries with moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction with wall motion abnormalities consistent with TS. Detailed history obtained retrospectively revealed that the patient took zolmitriptan sparingly only when she had migraines. But before this event, she was taking zolmitriptan 2-3 times daily for several days because of a persistent migraine headache. She otherwise reported that she is quite active, rides horses, and does show jumping without any limitations in her physical activity.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions that the patient took zolmitriptan before experiencing Takotsubo syndrome, and that she was physically active without any limitations. While it doesn't directly state that zolmitriptan has a negative correlation with hyperactivity, it suggests that zolmitriptan may have contributed to the patient's condition, and that the patient's physical activity level was not a factor. This provides some indication of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it's not a direct proof.",
