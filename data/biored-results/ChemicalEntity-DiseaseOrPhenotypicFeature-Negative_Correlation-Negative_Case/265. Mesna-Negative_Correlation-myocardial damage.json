  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"Mesna\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"myocardial damage\"]. While the snippet does not directly mention \"Negative_Correlation\" or \"myocardial damage\", it does mention that Mesna reduces the genotoxicity of ifosfamide and has an inhibitory effect on its cytostatic action. This suggests a negative correlation between Mesna and some form of cellular damage, which could be related to myocardial damage. However, the connection is not direct, and more information would be needed to confirm the RDF statement.",
