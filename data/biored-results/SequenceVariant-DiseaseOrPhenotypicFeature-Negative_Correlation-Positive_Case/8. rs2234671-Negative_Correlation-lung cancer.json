Previous studies of our group found association of haplotypes in the IL8 and in the CXCR2 genes with the multifactorial disease chronic periodontitis. In this study we investigated the polymorphism rs2234671 in 395 Brazilian subjects with and without chronic periodontitis.

  "LLM_anwser_parsed": false,
  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"rs2234671\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"lung cancer\"], and the snippet mentions that the polymorphism rs2234671 \"seemed to be functional as it was associated with decreased lung cancer risk\". This indicates a negative correlation between rs2234671 and lung cancer, which supports the RDF statement. However, the snippet does not provide direct proof, as it does not explicitly state \"rs2234671 has a negative correlation with lung cancer\".",
