  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"EGF\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"DDR2\"]. The snippet mentions \"EGF stimulation\" and \"ERK phosphorylation\", which suggests a possible correlation between EGF and ERK (not DDR2, though). However, it does not provide direct proof of a positive correlation between EGF and DDR2. Therefore, the RDF statement cannot be directly verified from the snippet, but the snippet does contain some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.",
