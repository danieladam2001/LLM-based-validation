While the snippet does not directly state that NRG-1 alpha has a positive correlation with BCR, it does mention that NRG-1 alpha has effects on Schwann cells, which are related to BCR (Breakpoint Cluster Region). Additionally, the snippet discusses the effects of NRG-1 alpha on MPNST cells, which could be related to BCR. However, the connection is not explicitly stated, and more information would be needed to confirm the RDF statement.",
