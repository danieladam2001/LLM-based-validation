We have studied the effects of oral treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate on a whole-animal model in which partial seizures can be elicited repeatedly on different days without changes in threshold or seizure patterns. In the animals treated with threshold doses of picrotoxin, the average number of seizures was 2.3+/-1.2, and average seizure duration was 39.5+/-8.4s. Pre-treatment with a dose of 30 mg/kg 2h before picrotoxin microperfusion prevented seizures in the 75% of the rats. Lower doses (3 and 10mg/kg) did not suppress seizures, however, after administration of 10mg/kg, significant reductions in seizures duration (24.3+/-6.8s) and seizure number (1.6+/-0.34) were found.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet does not directly state that there is a negative correlation between eslicarbazepine acetate and picrotoxin. However, it does suggest that eslicarbazepine acetate has an anticonvulsant effect on seizures induced by picrotoxin, which implies a negative correlation between the two. The snippet provides evidence that eslicarbazepine acetate can prevent or reduce seizures caused by picrotoxin, which supports the idea of a negative correlation.",
