Tenofovir has been implicated in the development of Fanconi syndrome and renal insufficiency because of its effects on the proximal renal tubule. Vancomycin nephrotoxicity is infrequent but may result from coadministration with a nephrotoxic agent. Clinicians should be aware that tenofovir may raise the risk of renal failure during prolonged administration of vancomycin.\n\n\nPlease, choose the correct option based on your answer!\na) The RDF statement can be directly verified from the snippet.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet does not directly mention a positive correlation between tenofovir and type 2 diabetes, but it does mention that tenofovir can cause renal insufficiency and raise the risk of renal failure. Type 2 diabetes is a known risk factor for renal disease, so there is an indirect connection between the two. However, the snippet does not provide direct proof of a positive correlation between tenofovir and type 2 diabetes.",
