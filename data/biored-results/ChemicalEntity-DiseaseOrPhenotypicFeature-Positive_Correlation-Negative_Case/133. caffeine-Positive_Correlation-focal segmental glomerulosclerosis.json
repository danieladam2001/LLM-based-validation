Renal angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AT2R) gene expression in adult offspring was reduced by PCE, whereas the renal angiotensin II receptor type 1a (AT1aR)/AT2R expression ratio was increased.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions that prenatal caffeine exposure (PCE) can induce glomerulosclerosis in adult offspring, which is related to the RDF statement [\"caffeine\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"focal segmental glomerulosclerosis\"]. Although the snippet does not explicitly mention \"focal segmental glomerulosclerosis\", it does mention \"glomerulosclerosis\" which is a broader term that includes focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Therefore, the snippet provides some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF statement, but it does not contain direct proof.",
