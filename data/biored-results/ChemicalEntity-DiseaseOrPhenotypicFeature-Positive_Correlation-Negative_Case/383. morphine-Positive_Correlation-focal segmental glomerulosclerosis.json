  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is c) The RDF statement definitely cannot be inferred from the snippet.The RDF statement claims a positive correlation between \"morphine\" and \"focal segmental glomerulosclerosis\", but the snippet does not mention \"focal segmental glomerulosclerosis\" at all. The snippet only talks about the effects of morphine on hippocampal long-term potentiation and the alleviating effects of CCK-8 on morphine-induced impairment. There is no connection or mention of \"focal segmental glomerulosclerosis\" in the snippet.",
