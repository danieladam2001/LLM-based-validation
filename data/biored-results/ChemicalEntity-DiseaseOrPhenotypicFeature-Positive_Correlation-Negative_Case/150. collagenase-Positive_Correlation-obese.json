  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"collagenase\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"obese\"], but the snippet does not mention \"obese\" at all. However, it does mention collagenase as a means to induce hemorrhage in the right striatum, which could be related to the concept of \"Positive_Correlation\". Therefore, the snippet provides some indirect indication of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not contain direct proof.",
