We report a case of 54-year-old woman with medical history of mitral valve prolapse and migraines, who was admitted to the hospital for substernal chest pain and electrocardiogram demonstrated 1/2 mm ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, aVF, V5, and V6 and positive troponin I. Emergent coronary angiogram revealed normal coronary arteries with moderately reduced left ventricular ejection fraction with wall motion abnormalities consistent with TS. Detailed history obtained retrospectively revealed that the patient took zolmitriptan sparingly only when she had migraines.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"TS\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"Ro4368554\"], which suggests a positive correlation between Takotsubo syndrome (TS) and Ro4368554 (which is likely a code for Zolmitriptan).The snippet provides some indications of this correlation, as it describes a case of Takotsubo syndrome (TS) in a patient who took Zolmitriptan (Ro4368554) frequently before the event. Although the snippet does not directly state a positive correlation, it suggests a possible link between the two, which is in line with the RDF statement.",
