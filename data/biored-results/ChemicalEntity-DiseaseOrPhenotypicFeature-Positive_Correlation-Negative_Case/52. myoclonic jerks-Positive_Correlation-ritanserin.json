Vigabatrin was also used in the treatment of two children.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions that two children developed myoclonic jerks after being treated with carbamazepine, which suggests a positive correlation between carbamazepine and myoclonic jerks. However, it does not directly mention ritanerin, which is part of the RDF statement. Therefore, the snippet provides some indication of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not contain direct proof.",
