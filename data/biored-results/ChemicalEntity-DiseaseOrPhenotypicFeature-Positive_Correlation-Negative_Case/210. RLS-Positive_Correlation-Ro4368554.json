Our patient started to have symptoms of RLS only after he had been treated with mirtazapine, and his RLS symptoms resolved completely upon discontinuation of his mirtazapine. Such a temporal relationship between the use of mirtazapine and the symptoms of RLS in our patient did not support a potentiating effect of domperione on mirtazapine-associated RLS.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"RLS\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"Ro4368554\"], but the snippet does not mention \"Ro4368554\" at all. However, it does mention RLS and its correlation with certain medications, which is related to the concept of positive correlation. Therefore, the snippet provides some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not contain direct proof.",
