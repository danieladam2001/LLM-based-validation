  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"STZ\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"focal segmental glomerulosclerosis\"]. However, the snippet does not mention \"focal segmental glomerulosclerosis\" at all. It does mention \"STZ\" (streptozotocin) and its effects on cognitive deficits, but it does not establish a positive correlation between STZ and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Therefore, the RDF statement cannot be directly verified from the snippet, but the snippet does provide some context about STZ, which is a part of the RDF statement.",
