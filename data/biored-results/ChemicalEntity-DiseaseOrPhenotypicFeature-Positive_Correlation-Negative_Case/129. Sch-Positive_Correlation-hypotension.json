  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions \"Succinylcholine (Sch)\" and \"hypotension\" is not mentioned at all. However, it does mention \"malignant hyperthermia\" which is a condition that is opposite to \"hypotension\". So, there is some indirect indication that Sch might be related to a condition that is not hypotension, but it's not a direct proof of a positive correlation between Sch and hypotension.",
