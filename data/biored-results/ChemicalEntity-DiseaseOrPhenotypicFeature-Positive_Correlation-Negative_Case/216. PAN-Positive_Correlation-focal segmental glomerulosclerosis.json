After 7 days, PAN treatment induced significant proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, decreased urinary sodium excretion, and extensive ascites.

Immunoperoxidase brightfield- and laser-scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy demonstrated increased targeting of alpha-ENaC, beta-ENaC, and gamma-ENaC subunits to the apical plasma membrane in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT2), connecting tubule, and cortical and medullary collecting duct segments. Immunoelectron microscopy further revealed an increased labeling of alpha-ENaC in the apical plasma membrane of cortical collecting duct principal cells of PAN-treated rats, indicating enhanced apical targeting of alpha-ENaC subunits.

In conclusion, the increased or sustained expression of ENaC subunits combined with increased apical targeting in the DCT2, connecting tubule, and collecting duct are likely to play a role in the sodium retention associated with PAN-induced nephrotic syndrome.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"PAN\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"focal segmental glomerulosclerosis\"]. However, the snippet does not directly mention \"focal segmental glomerulosclerosis\" or a positive correlation between PAN and it. The snippet does mention that PAN induces nephrotic syndrome, which is a broader category that includes focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Therefore, the snippet provides some indication that PAN might be related to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, but it does not provide direct proof.",
