  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions the relationship between glucose, insulin, and type II diabetes, which is related to the RDF statement [\"glucose\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"insulin\"]. However, it does not provide direct proof of a positive correlation between glucose and insulin. Instead, it discusses the association between genetic variability and estimates of insulin secretion in glucose-tolerant subjects, which suggests a connection between glucose and insulin, but does not explicitly state a positive correlation.",
