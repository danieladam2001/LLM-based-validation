  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"DYT2\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"Ro4368554\"], but the snippet does not mention \"Ro4368554\" at all. However, it does mention \"DYT2 dystonia\" and discusses the effects of mutations on hippocalcin, which could be related to the concept of \"Positive_Correlation\". Therefore, the snippet provides some indirect indications that could support the RDF statement, but it does not contain direct proof.",
