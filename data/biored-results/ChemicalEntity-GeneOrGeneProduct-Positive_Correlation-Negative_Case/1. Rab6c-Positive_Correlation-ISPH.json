Rab6c was found to be under-expressed in MCF7/AdrR and MES-SA/Dx5 (a human MDR uterine sarcoma cell line) compared with their non-MDR parental cell lines. MCF7/AdrR cells expressing the exogenous Rab6c exhibited less resistance to several anti-cancer drugs, such as doxorubicin (DOX), taxol, vinblastine, and vincristine, than the control cells containing the empty vector. Flow cytometry experiments confirmed that the transfectants' diminished resistance to DOX was caused by increased drug accumulation induced by the exogenous Rab6c.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"Rab6c\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"ISPH\"], which suggests a positive correlation between Rab6c and ISPH (increased sensitivity to pharmaceuticals). The snippet does not directly state this correlation, but it does provide evidence that Rab6c is involved in drug resistance and that its expression leads to increased drug accumulation, which is an indication of increased sensitivity to pharmaceuticals. Therefore, the snippet provides some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not directly prove it.",
