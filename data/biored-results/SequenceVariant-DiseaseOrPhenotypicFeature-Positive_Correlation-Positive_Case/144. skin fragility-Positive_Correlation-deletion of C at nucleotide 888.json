Skin biopsy revealed widening of intercellular spaces in the epidermis and a reduced number of small, poorly formed desmosomes. Mutation analysis of the plakophilin 1 gene PKP1 revealed a homozygous deletion of C at nucleotide 888 within exon 5. This mutation differs from the PKP1 gene pathology reported in 8 previously published individuals with this rare genodermatosis. However, all cases show similar clinical features, highlighting the importance of functional plakophilin 1 in maintaining desmosomal adhesion in skin, as well as the role of this protein in aspects of ectodermal development.\n\n\nPlease, choose the correct option based on your answer!\na) The RDF statement can be directly verified from the snippet.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is:a) The RDF statement can be directly verified from the snippet. The snippet contains direct proof.The RDF statement is [\"skin fragility\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"deletion of C at nucleotide 888\"], and the snippet explicitly mentions \"skin fragility\" as a symptom of the syndrome caused by the \"homozygous deletion of C at nucleotide 888\" in the plakophilin 1 gene. This direct connection between \"skin fragility\" and the genetic mutation provides direct proof for the RDF statement.",
