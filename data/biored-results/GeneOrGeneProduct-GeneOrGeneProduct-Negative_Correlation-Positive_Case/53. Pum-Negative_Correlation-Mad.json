The snippet contains direct proof.The RDF statement is [\"Pum\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"Mad\"], and the snippet explicitly states that \"Pum functions with... to translationally repress distinct targets, including the Mad and dMyc mRNAs.\" This directly verifies the RDF statement, showing a negative correlation between Pum and Mad.",
