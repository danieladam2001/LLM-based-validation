Here we describe two novel heterozygous mutations within the matriptase-2 (TMPRSS6) gene of monozygotic twin girls exhibiting an IRIDA phenotype.

The second mutation is the di-nucleotide substitution c.467C>A and c.468C>T in exon 3 that causes the missense mutation A118D in the SEA domain of the extracellular stem region of matriptase-2. Functional analysis of both variant matriptase-2 proteases has revealed that they lead to ineffective suppression of hepcidin transcription. We also demonstrate that the A118D SEA domain mutation causes an intra-molecular structural imbalance that impairs matriptase-2 activation.

  "LLM_anwser_parsed": false,
  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions that mutations in the matriptase-2 gene lead to elevated hepcidin levels, and that the mutations described in the text cause ineffective suppression of hepcidin transcription. This suggests a negative correlation between matriptase-2 and hepcidin, which is consistent with the RDF statement. However, the snippet does not provide direct proof of the RDF statement, as it does not explicitly state that matriptase-2 is negatively correlated with hepcidin.",
