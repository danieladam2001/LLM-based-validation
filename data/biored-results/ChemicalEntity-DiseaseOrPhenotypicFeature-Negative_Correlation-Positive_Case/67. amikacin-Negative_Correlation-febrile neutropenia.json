To evaluate amikacin-associated nephrotoxicity in an adult hematology/oncology population, a prospective, randomized, open-label trial was conducted at a university-affiliated medical center. Forty patients with a diagnosis consistent with a hematologic/oncologic disorder that required treatment with an aminoglycoside were randomized to either conventional or extended-interval amikacin. The occurrence of nephrotoxicity by means of an increase in serum creatinine and evaluation of efficacy via amikacin serum concentrations with respective pathogens were assessed. The occurrence of nephrotoxicity was similar between the conventional and extended-interval groups, at 10% and 5%, respectively (P = 1.00). Six patients in the conventional group had a positive culture, compared with none in the extended-interval group (P = 0.002).

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"amikacin\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"febrile neutropenia\"], which suggests that amikacin has a negative correlation with febrile neutropenia. The snippet does not directly state this, but it does mention that amikacin is used to treat febrile neutropenia, which implies that it may have a positive effect on the condition, rather than a negative correlation. However, the snippet also mentions that the efficacy of amikacin could not be assessed, which leaves some uncertainty. Therefore, the snippet provides some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not directly verify or contradict it.",
