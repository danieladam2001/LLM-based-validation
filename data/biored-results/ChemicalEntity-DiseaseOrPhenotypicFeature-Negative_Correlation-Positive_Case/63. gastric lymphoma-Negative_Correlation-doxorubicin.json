  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions \"doxorubicin-based chemotherapy\" and \"gastric lymphoma\", which are related to the RDF statement [\"gastric lymphoma\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"doxorubicin\"]. Although the snippet does not directly state a negative correlation between gastric lymphoma and doxorubicin, it does suggest that doxorubicin-based chemotherapy can have cardiac toxicity, which could be seen as a negative effect. Therefore, the snippet provides some indication of the truthfulness of the RDF statement, but it does not directly verify it.",
