DESIGN: A retrospective observational cohort study. SETTING: A major healthcare network involving four tertiary hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred thirty-five patients aged 76 and older admitted to a major healthcare network between July 1, 2001, and June 30, 2002, with atrial fibrillation on warfarin were enrolled. MEASUREMENTS: Information regarding major bleeding episodes, strokes, and warfarin use was obtained from patients, relatives, primary physicians, and medical records. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-eight patients (42% men) with a mean age of 81.1 (range 76-94) were included in the analysis. Total follow-up on warfarin was 530 years (mean 28 months). There were 53 major hemorrhages, for an annual rate of 10.0%, including 24 (45.3%) life-threatening and five (9.4%) fatal bleeds. The annual stroke rate after initiation of warfarin was 2.6%.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement [\"atrial fibrillation\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"warfarin\"] suggests a negative correlation between atrial fibrillation and warfarin. The snippet does not directly state this correlation, but it does provide information about the effectiveness of warfarin treatment in reducing the stroke rate in patients with atrial fibrillation, which could be interpreted as a negative correlation. However, the snippet does not provide direct proof of this correlation, so option a) is not correct. Option c) is also not correct because the snippet does provide some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.",
