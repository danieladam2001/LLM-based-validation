  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions that tacrolimus can induce scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc), which suggests a negative correlation between tacrolimus and SSc. However, it does not directly state that there is a negative correlation between the two. Therefore, the RDF statement can be inferred from the snippet, but it requires some interpretation and is not directly verified.",
