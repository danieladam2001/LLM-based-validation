  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions that \"Optimal control of the absences was achieved with sodium valproate, lamotrigine, or ethosuximide alone or in combination.\" This implies that sodium valproate is effective in controlling absence seizures, which is the opposite of a negative correlation. While it doesn't directly state that there is a negative correlation between absence seizures and sodium valproate, it suggests that sodium valproate is beneficial for absence seizures, which is an indication of the truthfulness of the RDF.",
