The aim of this study is to investigate and compare the protective effects of isotonic sodium chloride with sodium bicarbonate infusion and isotonic sodium chloride infusion with diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, in preventing CIN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study included patients who were administered 30-60 mL of iodinated contrast agent for percutaneous coronary angiography (PCAG), all with creatinine values between 1.1 and 3.1 mg/dL. Patients were divided into three groups and each group had 20 patients. The first group of patients was administered isotonic sodium chloride; the second group was administered a solution that of 5% dextrose and sodium bicarbonate, while the third group was administered isotonic sodium chloride before and after the contrast injection. The third group received an additional injection of diltiazem the day before and first 2 days after the contrast injection. All of the patients' plasma blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels were measured on the second and seventh day after the administration of intravenous contrast material. RESULTS: The basal creatinine levels were similar for all three groups (p > 0.05). Among a total of 60 patients included in the study, 16 patients developed acute renal failure (ARF) on the second day after contrast material was injected (26.6%). The number of patients who developed ARF on the second day after the injection in the first group was five (25%), in the second group was six (30%) and the third group was five (25%) (p > 0.05).

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"sodium bicarbonate\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"CIN\"], which suggests that sodium bicarbonate has a negative correlation with Contrast-Induced Nephropathy (CIN).The snippet does not directly prove this statement, but it provides some indications that support it. The study compares the effects of sodium bicarbonate infusion with other treatments in preventing CIN, and the results show that there is no significant difference between these treatments. This implies that sodium bicarbonate may not have a significant positive effect in preventing CIN, which could be interpreted as a negative correlation. However, the snippet does not provide direct proof of this correlation, hence option b) is the most appropriate answer.",
