  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"levodopa\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"idiopathic Parkinson's disease\"]. The snippet does not directly state that there is a negative correlation between levodopa and idiopathic Parkinson's disease. However, it does mention that levodopa therapy can lead to chronic adverse outcomes in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, and that a certain genetic variant (HOMER1 rs4704559 G allele) has a protective role in reducing the prevalence of these adverse effects. This suggests that there may be a negative correlation between levodopa and idiopathic Parkinson's disease, but it is not a direct proof.",
