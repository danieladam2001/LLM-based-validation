  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"CCK-8\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"memory impairment\"], which implies that CCK-8 has a negative correlation with memory impairment. The snippet does not directly state this, but it does suggest that CCK-8 has an ameliorative function on morphine-induced memory impairment, which implies a negative correlation. Therefore, the snippet provides some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not contain direct proof.",
