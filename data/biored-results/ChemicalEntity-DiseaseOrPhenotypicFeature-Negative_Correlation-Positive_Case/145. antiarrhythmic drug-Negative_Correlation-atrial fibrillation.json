  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions that amiodarone is an effective antiarrhythmic drug for cardioversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation, which implies a negative correlation between the two. However, it does not directly state that there is a negative correlation between antiarrhythmic drugs and atrial fibrillation. It provides evidence that amiodarone, a specific antiarrhythmic drug, is effective in treating atrial fibrillation, which suggests a negative correlation, but it does not explicitly state it.",
