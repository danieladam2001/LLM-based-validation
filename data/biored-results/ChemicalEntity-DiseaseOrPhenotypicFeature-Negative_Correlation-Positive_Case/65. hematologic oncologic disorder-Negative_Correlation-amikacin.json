The occurrence of nephrotoxicity by means of an increase in serum creatinine and evaluation of efficacy via amikacin serum concentrations with respective pathogens were assessed. The occurrence of nephrotoxicity was similar between the conventional and extended-interval groups, at 10% and 5%, respectively (P = 1.00).

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"hematologic/oncologic disorder\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"amikacin\"]. The snippet does not directly state that there is a negative correlation between hematologic/oncologic disorder and amikacin, but it does provide some indications that support this statement. For example, the study found that the occurrence of nephrotoxicity was similar between the conventional and extended-interval groups, which suggests that amikacin may not have a strong correlation with hematologic/oncologic disorder. Additionally, the study focused on evaluating amikacin-associated nephrotoxicity in a hematology/oncology population, which implies that there may be some negative correlation between the two. However, the snippet does not provide direct proof of the RDF statement, hence option b is the correct answer.",
