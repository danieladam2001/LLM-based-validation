  "LLM_anwser_parsed": false,
  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement claims that there is a negative correlation between pilocarpine and ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. The snippet does not directly state this, but it does mention that pilocarpine \"decreased the time course of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation\", which suggests a negative correlation. However, it does not provide direct proof, so option a) is not correct. Option c) is also not correct because the snippet does provide some indication of the truthfulness of the RDF statement.",
