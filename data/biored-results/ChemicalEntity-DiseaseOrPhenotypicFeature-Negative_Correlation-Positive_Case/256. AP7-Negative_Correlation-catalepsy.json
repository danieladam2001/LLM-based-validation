  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"AP7\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"catalepsy\"]. The snippet mentions that intracollicular microinjection of AP7 significantly attenuated the catalepsy, which suggests a negative correlation between AP7 and catalepsy. However, the snippet does not directly state that AP7 has a negative correlation with catalepsy, but rather provides evidence that supports this claim.",
