  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions that corticosteroid therapy was used to treat acute interstitial nephritis, but it also states that renal function remained impaired. This suggests a negative correlation between corticosteroids and interstitial nephritis, but it does not provide direct proof. The RDF statement cannot be directly verified from the snippet, but the snippet does contain some indications that support the truthfulness of the RDF.",
