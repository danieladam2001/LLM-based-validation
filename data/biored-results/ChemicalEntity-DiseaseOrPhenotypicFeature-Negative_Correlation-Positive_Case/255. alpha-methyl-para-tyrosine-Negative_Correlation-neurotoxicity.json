In addition, we demonstrate that mice genetically engineered to have unilateral brain DA deficits develop METH-induced dopaminergic deficits that are of comparable magnitude on both sides of the brain.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions \"alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine\" and \"neurotoxicity\" in the same sentence, indicating a possible correlation between the two. Although it does not explicitly state a \"Negative_Correlation\", it suggests that alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine has a protective effect on METH-induced DA neurotoxicity, which implies a negative correlation. Therefore, the snippet provides some indication of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not directly prove it.",
