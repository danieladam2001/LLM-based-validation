  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet does not directly state that \"mPGES-1\" has a \"Positive_Correlation\" with \"polyuria\", but it provides evidence that mPGES-1 is involved in the development of lithium-induced polyuria, and that the absence of mPGES-1 leads to resistance to polyuria. This suggests a positive correlation between mPGES-1 and polyuria, but it requires some inference to reach this conclusion.",
