  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions \"cancer\" and \"mTOR\" and describes a relationship between them, where mTOR signaling is involved in the metabolic symbiosis of cancer cells. Although it does not explicitly state a \"Positive_Correlation\" between \"cancer\" and \"mTOR\", it implies a connection between the two, which is in line with the RDF statement. However, the snippet does not provide direct proof of a positive correlation, hence option b) is the most suitable choice.",
