  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"CIN\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"Mad2\"]. The snippet mentions \"Chromosome instability (CIN) is associated with poor survival and therapeutic outcome in a number of malignancies\", which implies a positive correlation between CIN and Mad2. However, it does not directly state that Mad2 causes CIN, but rather that they are associated. Therefore, the snippet provides some indication of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not contain direct proof.",
