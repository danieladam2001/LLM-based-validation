In cells stained with fluorescent dyes targeting lysosomes, CAA induced an increase in lysosomal size and lysosomal leakage. The effects of CAA on cysteine protease activities and thiols could be reproduced in cell lysate. Acidification, which slowed the reaction of CAA with thiol donors, could also attenuate effects of CAA on necrosis markers, thiol depletion and cysteine protease inhibition in living cells.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"CAA\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"STL2\"], which suggests a negative correlation between CAA and STL2. While the snippet does not directly state this correlation, it does provide evidence that CAA depletes free thiols (STL2) in human proximal tubule cells, which implies a negative correlation. Therefore, the snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not provide direct proof.",
