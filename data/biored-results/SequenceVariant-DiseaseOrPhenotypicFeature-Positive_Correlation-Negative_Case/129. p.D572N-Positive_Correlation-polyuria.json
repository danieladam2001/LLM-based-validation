  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"p.D572N\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"polyuria\"], but the snippet does not directly mention \"polyuria\" or a \"Positive_Correlation\" between p.D572N and polyuria. However, the snippet does mention p.D572N and discusses genotype-phenotype correlations, which could be related to the RDF statement. Therefore, the snippet provides some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not contain direct proof.",
