  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"PD\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"1123T-->G\"], but the snippet does not mention \"1123T-->G\" at all. However, it does mention a positive correlation between the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism and the risk of PD, which is similar to the RDF statement. Additionally, it mentions a single nucleotide polymorphism rs25531(A-->G), which is close to the RDF statement but not exactly the same. Therefore, the snippet provides some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not contain direct proof.",
