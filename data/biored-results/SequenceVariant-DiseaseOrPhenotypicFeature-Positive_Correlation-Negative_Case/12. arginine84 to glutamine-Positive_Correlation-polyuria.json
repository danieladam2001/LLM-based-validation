  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The snippet mentions the substitution of arginine84 with glutamine, which is part of the RDF statement. However, it does not explicitly mention the correlation with polyuria, which is the other part of the RDF statement. Therefore, the snippet provides some indication of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not contain direct proof.",
