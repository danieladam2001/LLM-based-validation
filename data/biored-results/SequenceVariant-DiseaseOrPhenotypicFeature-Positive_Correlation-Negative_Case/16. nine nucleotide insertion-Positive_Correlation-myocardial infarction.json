  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"nine nucleotide insertion\" - \"Positive_Correlation\" - \"myocardial infarction\"], but the snippet does not mention \"myocardial infarction\" at all. However, it does mention a \"nine nucleotide insertion\" (AFF344-345ins) in the WFS1 gene, which is associated with Wolfram syndrome. While there is no direct correlation with myocardial infarction, the snippet provides some indication that the nine nucleotide insertion is related to a genetic disorder, which could be seen as a positive correlation. However, it is not a direct proof, hence option b is the correct answer.",
