  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"insulin\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"type 1 diabetes\"]. The snippet does not directly state that there is a negative correlation between insulin and type 1 diabetes. However, it does mention that glucagon receptor blockade is an alternative to insulin monotherapy for treating type 1 diabetes, which implies that insulin is related to type 1 diabetes. Additionally, the snippet discusses the effects of ghrelin and glucagon on blood glucose levels in the context of type 1 diabetes, which indirectly suggests a connection between insulin and type 1 diabetes. Therefore, the snippet provides some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not contain direct proof.",
