Gorlin syndrome is a rare inherited autosomal dominant disease that predisposes with multiple BCCs and other birth defects. Both sporadic and inherited BCCs are associated with mutations in the tumor suppressor gene PTCH1, but there is still uncertainty on the role of its homolog PTCH2. OBJECTIVES: To search for mutations and genomic instability in sporadic and inherited BCCs. METHODS: DNA obtained from leukocytes and tumor cells was amplified by polymerase chain reaction regarding five exons of PTCH1 and PTCH2 and neighboring microsatellites. Exons were sequenced and compared with the GenBank database. RESULTS: Only D9S180, of six microsatellites, showed loss of heterozygosity in three BCCs (two sporadic and one inherited). One sporadic BCC presented the mutation g.2885G>C in exon 17 of PTCH1, which predicts the substitution p.R962T in an external domain of the protein. In addition, the leukocytes and tumor cells of one patient with Gorlin syndrome showed the mutation g.2839T>G in the same exon and gene, which predicts a p.E947stop and truncated protein. All control and tumor samples presented IVS9 + 217T in intron 9 of PTCH1. CONCLUSION: Mutations found in the PTCH1 gene and neighboring repetitive sequences may have contributed to the development of the studied BCCs.\n\n\nPlease, choose the correct option based on your answer!\na) The RDF statement can be directly verified from the snippet.

  "LLM_answer_raw": "The correct answer is b) The snippet contains some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF.The RDF statement is [\"tumor\" - \"Negative_Correlation\" - \"PTCH1\"], which suggests that PTCH1 is negatively correlated with tumors. The snippet provides evidence that mutations in the PTCH1 gene are associated with basal cell carcinomas (tumors), but it does not explicitly state a negative correlation. However, it can be inferred that PTCH1 mutations may contribute to the development of tumors, which is an indirect indication of the truthfulness of the RDF statement.",
