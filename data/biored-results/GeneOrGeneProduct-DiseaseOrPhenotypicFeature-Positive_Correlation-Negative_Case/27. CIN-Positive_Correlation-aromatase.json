The snippet mentions \"Chromosome instability (CIN) is associated with poor survival and therapeutic outcome in a number of malignancies\", which indicates a positive correlation between CIN and poor outcomes. However, there is no mention of \"aromatase\" in the snippet, so the RDF statement cannot be directly verified.",
