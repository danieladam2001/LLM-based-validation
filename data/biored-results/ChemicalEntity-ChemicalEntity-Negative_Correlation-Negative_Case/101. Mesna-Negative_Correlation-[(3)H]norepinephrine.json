The snippet does not directly mention [(3)H]norepinephrine, but it does mention the negative correlation between Mesna and the genotoxicity of ifosfamide, which can be inferred as a negative correlation. Therefore, the snippet provides some indications of the truthfulness of the RDF, but it does not contain direct proof.",
